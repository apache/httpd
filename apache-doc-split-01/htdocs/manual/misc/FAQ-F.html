 <LI><A NAME="CGIoutsideScriptAlias">
      <STRONG>How do I enable CGI execution in directories other than
      the ScriptAlias?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache recognizes all files in a directory named as a
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias"><SAMP>ScriptAlias</SAMP></A>
  as being eligible for execution rather than processing as normal
  documents.  This applies regardless of the file name, so scripts in a
  ScriptAlias directory don't need to be named
  &quot;<SAMP>*.cgi</SAMP>&quot; or &quot;<SAMP>*.pl</SAMP>&quot; or
  whatever.  In other words, <EM>all</EM> files in a ScriptAlias
  directory are scripts, as far as Apache is concerned.
  </P>
  <P>
  To persuade Apache to execute scripts in other locations, such as in
  directories where normal documents may also live, you must tell it how
  to recognize them - and also that it's okay to execute them.  For
  this, you need to use something like the
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><SAMP>AddHandler</SAMP></A>
  directive.
  </P>
  <P>
  <OL>
   <LI>In an appropriate section of your server configuration files, add
    a line such as
    <P>
    <DL>
     <DD><CODE>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi</CODE>
     </DD>
    </DL>
    <P></P>
    <P>
    The server will then recognize that all files in that location (and
    its logical descendants) that end in &quot;<SAMP>.cgi</SAMP>&quot;
    are script files, not documents.
    </P>
   </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="premature-script-headers">
      <STRONG>What does it mean when my CGIs fail with
      &quot;<SAMP>Premature end of script headers</SAMP>&quot;?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  It means just what it says: the server was expecting a complete set of
  HTTP headers (one or more followed by a blank line), and didn't get
  them.
  </P>
  <P>
  The most common cause of this problem is the script dying before
  sending the complete set of headers, or possibly any at all, to the
  server.  To see if this is the case, try running the script standalone
  from an interactive session, rather than as a script under the server.
  If you get error messages, this is almost certainly the cause of the
  &quot;premature end of script headers&quot; message.  Even if the CGI 
  runs fine from the command line, remember that the environment and
  permissions may be different when running under the web server.  The
  CGI can only access resources allowed for the <A 
  HREF="../mod/core.html#user"><CODE>User</CODE></A> and 
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#group"><CODE>Group</CODE></A> specified in 
  your Apache configuration.  In addition, the environment will not be 
  the same as the one provided on the command line, but it can be 
  adjusted using the directives provided by <A 
  HREF="../mod/mod_env.html">mod_env</A>.
  </P>
  <P>
  The second most common cause of this (aside from people not
  outputting the required headers at all) is a result of an interaction
  with Perl's output buffering.  To make Perl flush its buffers
  after each output statement, insert the following statements around
  the <CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>write</CODE> statements that send your
  HTTP headers:
  </P>
  <P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>{<BR>
    &nbsp;local ($oldbar) = $|;<BR>
    &nbsp;$cfh = select (STDOUT);<BR>
    &nbsp;$| = 1;<BR>
    &nbsp;#<BR>
    &nbsp;# print your HTTP headers here<BR>
    &nbsp;#<BR>
    &nbsp;$| = $oldbar;<BR>
    &nbsp;select ($cfh);<BR>
    }</CODE>
   </DD>
  </DL>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  This is generally only necessary when you are calling external
  programs from your script that send output to stdout, or if there will
  be a long delay between the time the headers are sent and the actual
  content starts being emitted.  To maximize performance, you should
  turn buffer-flushing back <EM>off</EM> (with <CODE>$| = 0</CODE> or the
  equivalent) after the statements that send the headers, as displayed
  above.
  </P>
  <P>
  If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent thing for
  whatever language you <EM>are</EM> using (<EM>e.g.</EM>, for C, call
  <CODE>fflush()</CODE> after writing the headers).
  </P>
  <P>
  Another cause for the &quot;premature end of script headers&quot;
  message are the RLimitCPU and RLimitMEM directives. You may
  get the message if the CGI script was killed due to a
  resource limit.
  </P>
  <P>
  In addition, a configuration problem in <A
  HREF="../suexec.html">suEXEC</A>, mod_perl, or another third party
  module can often interfere with the execution of your CGI and cause
  the &quot;premature end of script headers&quot; message.

 <LI><A NAME="POSTnotallowed">
      <STRONG>Why do I keep getting &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot; for 
      form POST requests?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  This is almost always due to Apache not being configured to treat the
  file you are trying to POST to as a CGI script.  You can not POST 
  to a normal HTML file; the operation has no meaning.  See the FAQ 
  entry on <A HREF="#CGIoutsideScriptAlias">CGIs outside ScriptAliased
  directories</A> for details on how to configure Apache to treat the
  file in question as a CGI.

 <LI><A NAME="nph-scripts">
      <STRONG>How can I get my script's output without Apache buffering
      it?  Why doesn't my server push work?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  As of Apache 1.3, CGI scripts are essentially not buffered.  Every time
  your script does a "flush" to output data, that data gets relayed on to
  the client.  Some scripting languages, for example Perl, have their own
  buffering for output - this can be disabled by setting the <CODE>$|</CODE>
  special variable to 1.  Of course this does increase the overall number
  of packets being transmitted, which can result in a sense of slowness for 
  the end user.
  </P>
  <P>Prior to 1.3, you needed to use "nph-" scripts to accomplish
  non-buffering.  Today, the only difference between nph scripts and
  normal scripts is that nph scripts require the full HTTP headers to
  be sent.

 <LI><A NAME="cgi-spec">
      <STRONG>Where can I find the &quot;CGI specification&quot;?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification can be found at
  the original NCSA site 
  &lt;<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html">
  <SAMP>http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html</SAMP></A>&gt;.

  A new draft is being worked on with the intent of making it an informational

 <LI><A NAME="fastcgi">
      <STRONG>Why isn't FastCGI included with Apache any more?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  The simple answer is that it was becoming too difficult to keep the
  version being included with Apache synchronized with the master copy
  at the
  <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/"
  >FastCGI web site</A>.  When a new version of Apache was released, the
  version of the FastCGI module included with it would soon be out of date.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can still obtain the FastCGI module for Apache from the master
  FastCGI web site.

 <LI><A NAME="ssi-part-i">
      <STRONG>How do I enable SSI (parsed HTML)?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  SSI (an acronym for Server-Side Include) directives allow static HTML
  documents to be enhanced at run-time (<EM>e.g.</EM>, when delivered to
  a client by Apache).  The format of SSI directives is covered
  in the <A HREF="../mod/mod_include.html">mod_include manual</A>;
  suffice it to say that Apache supports not only SSI but
  xSSI (eXtended SSI) directives.
  </P>
  <P>
  Processing a document at run-time is called <EM>parsing</EM> it; hence
  the term &quot;parsed HTML&quot; sometimes used for documents that
  contain SSI instructions.  Parsing tends to be <EM>extremely</EM>
  resource-consumptive, and is not enabled by default.  It can also
  interfere with the cachability of your documents, which can put a
  further load on your server.  (see the
  <A HREF="#ssi-part-ii">next question</A> for more information about this.)
  </P>
  <P>
  To enable SSI processing, you need to
  </P>
  <UL>
   <LI>Build your server with the
    <A HREF="../mod/mod_include.html"><SAMP>mod_include</SAMP></A>
    module.  This is normally compiled in by default.
   </LI>
   <LI>Make sure your server configuration files have an
    <A HREF="../mod/core.html#options"><SAMP>Options</SAMP></A>
    directive which permits <SAMP>Includes</SAMP>.
   </LI>
   <LI>Make sure that the directory where you want the SSI documents to
    live is covered by the &quot;server-parsed&quot; content handler,
    either explicitly or in some ancestral location.  That can be done
    with the following
    <A HREF="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><SAMP>AddHandler</SAMP></A>
    directive:
    <P>
    <DL>
     <DD><CODE>AddHandler server-parsed .shtml</CODE>
     </DD>
    </DL>
    <P></P>
    <P>
    This indicates that all files ending in &quot;.shtml&quot; in that
    location (or its descendants) should be parsed.  Note that using
    &quot;.html&quot; will cause all normal HTML files to be parsed,
    which may put an inordinate load on your server.
    </P>

  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="ssi-part-ii">
      <STRONG>Why don't my parsed files get cached?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Since the server is performing run-time processing of your SSI
  directives, which may change the content shipped to the client, it
  can't know at the time it starts parsing what the final size of the
  result will be, or whether the parsed result will always be the same.
  This means that it can't generate <SAMP>Content-Length</SAMP> or
  <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> headers.  Caches commonly work by comparing
  the <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> of what's in the cache with that being
  delivered by the server.  Since the server isn't sending that header
  for a parsed document, whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether
  the document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be on the
  safe side.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can work around this in some cases by causing an
  <SAMP>Expires</SAMP> header to be generated.  (See the
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_expires.html" REL="Help"><SAMP>mod_expires</SAMP></A>
  documentation for more details.)  Another possibility is to use the
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_include.html#xbithack" REL="Help"
  ><SAMP>XBitHack Full</SAMP></A>
  mechanism, which tells Apache to send (under certain circumstances
  detailed in the XBitHack directive description) a
  <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> header based upon the last modification
  time of the file being parsed.  Note that this may actually be lying
  to the client if the parsed file doesn't change but the SSI-inserted
  content does; if the included content changes often, this can result
  in stale copies being cached.

  So you want to include SSI directives in the output from your CGI
  script, but can't figure out how to do it?
  The short answer is &quot;you can't.&quot;  This is potentially
  a security liability and, more importantly, it can not be cleanly
  implemented under the current server API.  The best workaround
  is for your script itself to do what the SSIs would be doing.
  After all, it's generating the rest of the content.
