                             Version 1.3 (and up)

  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache is an HTTP server, originally designed for Unix systems. This
  is the version of Apache for Microsoft Windows NT, 98, and 95
  systems.  Like the Unix version, it includes many frequently
  requested new features, and has an API that allows it to be extended
  to meet users' needs more easily. It also allows ISAPI extensions.


  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Apache HTTP
  server project page under http://www.apache.org/.

  Documentation
  -------------

  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  also included, in HTML format, in the htdocs/manual/ directory.
  For the most up-to-date documentation can be found on
  http://www.apache.org/docs/. For Windows specific information, see
  http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html.

  WARNING
  -------

  Apache on Win32 has not yet been optimized for performance.  Apache
  still performs best, and is most reliable on Unix platforms.  Over
  time we will improve performance for Windows NT. Folks doing
  comparative reviews of webserver performance are asked to compare
  against Apache on a Unix platform such as Solaris, FreeBSD, or
  Linux.

  Apache on Win32 should still be considered beta quality code.  It
  does not meet the normal standards of stability and security that
  Unix releases do.

  Installation
  ------------

  If you have installed Apache as a pre-compiled binary, you can
  now run the server by selecting "Start Apache as console app"
  from the Start menu. You can configure Apache for your system
  by editing the file conf/httpd.conf in the directory where you
  installed Apache.

  See the http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html for details of how
  to run and configure Apache, or select the "Apache Documentation"
  icon read the local copy installed with Apache.

  Known Problems
  --------------

  To get information about the current set of known problems, see the
  online bug reporting database at
  http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html.  Bugs which affect Apache on
  Windows and not Apache on Unix can be found under the category
  "os-windows".
