    <description>Managing domains across virtual hosts, certificate provisioning

    <summary>
        <p>
        This module manages common properties of domains for one or more virtual hosts. 
        Specifically it can use the ACME protocol
        (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-acme/">RFC Draft</a>) 
        to automate certificate provisioning. These will be configured for managed domains and
        their virtual hosts automatically. This includes renewal of certificates before they
        expire. The most famous Certificate Authority currently implementing the ACME protocol
        is <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.</p>
        
        <note type="warning"><title>Warning</title>
            <p>This module is experimental. Its behaviors, directives, and 
                defaults are subject to more change from release to 
                release relative to other standard modules. Users are encouraged to 
                consult the "CHANGES" file for potential updates.</p>
        </note>

        <p>Simple configuration example:</p>

        <p>
            This setup will, on server start, contact
            <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>
            to request a certificate for the domain. If Let's Encrypt can verify the ownership
            of the domain, the module will retrieve the certificate and its chain, store it
            in the local file system (see <directive module="mod_md">MDStoreDir</directive>)
            and provide it, on next restart, to <module>mod_ssl</module>.
        </p><p>
            This happens while the server is already running. All other hosts will continue
            to work as before. While a certificate is not available, requests for the managed
            domain will be answered with a '503 Service Unavailable'. 
        </p>
        </note>

        <note><title>Prerequisites</title>
        <p>
            This module requires <module>mod_watchdog</module> to be loaded as well.
        </p><p>
            Certificate signup and renewal with Let's Encrypt requires your server to be
            reachable on port 80 (http:) from the outside. The alternative method over
            port 443 (https:) is currently disabled for security reasons (status from
            2018-01-14).
        </p><p>
            The module will select from the methods offered by Let's Encrypt. If LE decides
            at one point in the future, to re-enable it again, <module>mod_md</module> will
            use it when suitable.
        </p><p>
            But for now, only the port 80 variant is available (termed "http-01"). Only
            when LE can reach your server on port 80 will <module>mod_md</module> work for
            you. For now, at least.
        </p><p>
            If you do not want to offer any sites on port 80 any more, you may leave it open
            and redirect all requests to your https: sites instead. Use the
            <directive module="mod_md">MDRequireHttps</directive> described below to do
            that in a convenient fashion. This will continue to answer http: challenges
            from Let's Encrypt.

        <usage>
            <p>
                All the names in the list are managed as one Managed Domain (MD). 
                <module>mod_md</module> will request one single certificate that is valid for all these names. This
                directive uses the global settings (see other MD directives below). If you
                need specific settings for one MD, use
                the <directive module="mod_md" type="section">MDomainSet</directive>.
            </p><p>
                There are 2 additional settings that are necessary for a Managed Domain:
                <directive module="core">ServerAdmin</directive>
                and <directive module="mod_md">MDCertificateAgreement</directive>.
                The mail address of <directive module="core">ServerAdmin</directive>
                is used to register at the CA (Let's Encrypt by default).
                The CA may use it to notify you about
                changes in its service or status of your certificates.
            </p><p>
                The second setting, <directive module="mod_md">MDCertificateAgreement</directive>, 
                is the URL of the Terms of Service of the CA. When you configure the URL, 
                you confirm that you have read and agree to the terms described in the linked 
                document. Before you do that, the CA will  not hand out certificates to you.

                name list as is configured ('manual') or offer more convenience. With 'auto'
                all names of a virtual host are added to a MD. Conventiently, 'auto' is also
                the default.

            properties (e.g. certificate management) whenever necessary. When a MD is not used
            in any virtual host, the module will do nothing. When a certificate is missing, it
            will try to get one. When a certificate expires soon (see 
            <directive module="mod_md">MDRenewWindow</directive>), it will
            renew it.
            </p><p>
            In 'manual' mode, it is your duty to do all this. The module will provide the existing

            This can be useful in clustered setups where you want just one node to perform

        <usage>
            <p>
                The ACME protocol provides two methods to verify domain ownership: one that uses
                port 80 and one for port 443. If your server is not reachable by at least one
                of the two, ACME will not work for you.
            </p><p>
                <module>mod_md</module> will look at your server configuration and try to figure
                out which of those are available. Then it can select the proper ACME challenge
                to create a certificate for your site.
            </p><p>
                However if you have some fancy port forwarding in place, your server may be
                reachable from the Internet on port 443, but the local port that httpd uses is
                another one. Your server might only listen on ports 5001 and 5002, but be reached
                on ports 443 and 80. How should <module>mod_md</module> figure that one out?
            </p><p>
                With <directive>MDPortMap</directive> you can tell it which 'Internet port'
                corresponds to which local port.

                This example says that the server is not reachable on port 80 from the outside, but

            <p>
                Defines what kind of private keys are generated for a managed domain and with
                what parameters. The only supported type right now is 'RSA' and the only parameter
                it takes is the number of bits used for the key.
            </p><p>
                The current (2017) recommendation is at least 2048 bits and a smaller number is
                not accepted here. Higher numbers offer longer security, but are computationally more 
                expensive, e.g. increase the load on your server. That might or might not be an
                issue for you.
            </p><p>
                Other key types will be defined in the future.

                Please note that this setting only has an effect on new keys. Any existing
                private key you have remains unaffected. Also, this only affects private keys
                generated for certificates. ACME account keys are unaffected by this.

            Normally, certificates are valid for around 90 days and <module>mod_md</module> will renew 
            them the earliest 33% of their complete lifetime before they expire (so for 
            90 days validity, 30 days before it expires). If you think this is not what 
            you need, you can specify either the exact time, as in:

            <p>When in auto drive mode, the module will check every 12 hours at least 
            what the status of the managed domains is and if it needs to do something. 
            On errors, for example when the CA is unreachable, it will initially retry

            to the https: ones, for now. This is safe and you can remove this again at
            any time.
            </p><p>
                <strong>The following has consequences: </strong>if you want client to <strong>no longer</strong> use the
             http: URLs, configure:

            </example>
            <p>This does two things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>All request to the <code>http:</code> resources are redirected to the
                    same url with the <code>https:</code> scheme using the <code>301</code>
                status code. This tells clients that this is intended to be forever and
                the should update any links they have accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>All answers to <code>https:</code> requests will carry the header
                    <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> with a life time of half a year.
                    This tells the browser that it <strong>never</strong> (for half a year) shall use <code>http:</code>
                    when talking to this domain name. Browsers will, after having seen this, refuse
                    to contact your unencrypted site. This prevents malicious middleware to
                    downgrade connections and listen/manipulate the traffic. Which is good. But
                    you cannot simply take it back again.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can achieve the same with <module>mod_alias</module> and some
            <directive module="mod_alias">Redirect</directive> configuration,
            basically. If you do it yourself, please make sure to exclude the paths 
            /.well-known/* from your redirection, otherwise <module>mod_md</module> 
            might have trouble signing on new certificates.
            </p>
