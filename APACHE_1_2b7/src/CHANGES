Changes with Apache 1.2b7

  *) unset Content-Length if chunked (RFC-2068) [Petr Lampa]

  *) mod_negotiation fixes [Petr Lampa] PR#157, PR#158, PR#159
     - replace protocol response numbers with symbols
     - save variant-list into main request notes
     - free allocated memory from subrequests
     - merge notes, headers_out and err_headers_out

  *) changed status check mask in proxy_http.c from "HTTP/#.# ### *" to
     "HTTP/#.# ###*" to be more lenient about what we accept.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) more proxy FTP bug fixes:
     - Changed send_dir() to remove user/passwd from displayed URL.
     - Changed login error messages to be more descriptive. 
     - remove setting of SO_DEBUG socket option
     - Make ftp_getrc() more lenient about multiline responses,
       specifically, 230 responses which don't have continuation 230-
       on each line). These seem to be all NT FTP servers, and while
       perhaps questionable, they appear to be legal by RFC 959.
     - Add missing kill_timeout() after transfer to user completes.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Fixed problem where a busy server could hang when restarting
     after being sent a SIGHUP due to child processes not exiting.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Modify mod_include escaping so a '\' only signifies an escaped
     character if the next character is one that needs
     escaping.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Eliminated possible infinite loop in mod_imap when relative URLs are
     used with a 'base' directive that does not have a '/' in it.
     [Marc Slemko, reported by Onno Witvliet <onno@tc.hsa.nl>]

  *) Reduced the default timeout from 1200 seconds to 300, and the
     one in the sample configfile from 400 to 300.  [Marc Slemko]

  *) Stop vbprintf from crashing if given a NULL string pointer; 
     print (null) instead.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Don't disable Nagle algorithm if system doesn't have TCP_NODELAY.
     [Marc Slemko and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed problem with mod_cgi-generated internal redirects trying to
     read the request message-body twice. [Archie Cobbs and Roy Fielding]

  *) Reduced timeout on lingering close, removed possibility of a blocked
     read causing the child to hang, and stopped logging of errors if
     the socket is not connected (reset by client).  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Rearranged main child loop to remove duplication of code in
     select/accept and keep-alive requests, fixed several bugs regarding
     checking scoreboard_image for exit indication and failure to
     account for all success conditions and trap all error conditions,
     prevented multiple flushes before closing the socket; close the entire
     socket buffer instead of just one descriptor, prevent logging of
     EPROTO and ECONNABORTED on platforms where supported, and generally
     improved readability.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Extensive performance improvements. Cleaned up inefficient use of
     auto initializers, multiple is_matchexp calls on a static string,
     and excessive merging of response_code_strings. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added double-buffering to mod_include to improve performance on
     server-side includes. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Several fixes for suexec wrapper. [Randy Terbush]
     - Make wrapper work for files on NFS filesystem.
     - Fix portability problem of MAXPATHLEN.
     - Fix array overrun problem in clean_env().
     - Fix allocation of PATH environment variable

  *) Removed extraneous blank line is description of mod_status chars.
     [Kurt Kohler]

  *) Logging of errors from the call_exec routine simply went nowhere,
     since the logfile fd has been closed, so now we send them to stderr.
     [Harald T. Alvestrand]

  *) Fixed core dump when DocumentRoot is a CGI.
     [Ben Laurie, reported by geddis@tesserae.com]

  *) Fixed potential file descriptor leak in mod_asis; updated it and
     http_core to use pfopen/pfclose instead of fopen/fclose.
     [Randy Terbush and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed handling of unsigned ints in ap_snprintf() on some chips such
     as the DEC Alpha which is 64-bit but uses 32-bit ints. 
     [Dean Gaudet and Ken Coar]

  *) Return a 302 response code to the client when sending a redirect
     due to a missing trailing '/' on a directory instead of a 301; now
     it is cacheable. [Markus Gyger]

  *) Fix condition where, if a bad directive occurs in .htaccess, and
     sub_request() goes first to this directory, then log_reason() will
     SIGSEGV because it doesn't have initialized r->per_dir_config.
     [PR#162 from Petr Lampa, fix by Marc Slemko and Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix handling of lang_index in is_variant_better().  This was
     causing problems which resulted in the server sending the
     wrong language document in some cases. [Petr Lampa]

  *) Remove free() from clean_env() in suexec wrapper. This was nuking
     the clean environment on some systems.

  *) Tweak byteserving code (e.g. serving PDF files) to work around
     bugs in Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
     Emit Content-Length header when sending multipart/byteranges.
     [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Port to HI-UX/WE2. [Nick Maclaren]

  *) Port to HP MPE operating system for HP 3000 machines
     [Mark Bixby <markb@cccd.edu>]

  *) Fixed bug which caused a segmentation fault if only one argument
     given to RLimit* directives. [Ed Korthof]

  *) Continue persistent connection after 204 or 304 response. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Improved buffered output to the client by delaying the flush decision
     until the BUFF code is actually about to read the next request.
     This fixes a problem introduced in 1.2b5 with clients that send
     an extra CRLF after a POST request. Also improved chunked output
     performance by combining writes using writev() and removing as
     many bflush() calls as possible.  NOTE: Platforms without writev()
     must add -DNO_WRITEV to the compiler CFLAGS, either in Configuration
     or Configure, unless we have already done so.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed mod_rewrite bug which truncated the rewritten URL [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fixed mod_info output corruption bug introduced by buffer overflow
     fixes. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed http_protocol to correctly output all HTTP/1.1 headers, including
     for the special case of a 304 response.  [Paul Sutton]

  *) Improved handling of TRACE method by bypassing normal method handling
     and header parsing routines; fixed Allow response to always allow TRACE.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fixed compiler warnings in the regex library. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Cleaned-up some of the generated HTML. [Ken Coar]

Changes with Apache 1.2b6

  *) Allow whitespace in imagemap mapfile coordinates. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix typo introduced in fix for potential infinite loop around
     accept() in child_main(). This change caused the rev to 1.2b6.
     1.2b5 was never a public beta.

Changes with Apache 1.2b5

  *) Change KeepAlive semantics (On|Off instead of a number), add
     MaxKeepAliveRequests directive. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Various NeXT compilation patches, as well as a change in
     regex/regcomp.c since that file also used a NEXT define.
     [Andreas Koenig]

  *) Allow * to terminate the end of a directory match in mod_dir.
     Allows /~* to match for both /~joe and /~joe/. [David Bronder]

  *) Don't call can_exec() if suexec_enabled. Calling this requires
     scripts executed by the suexec wrapper to be world executable, which
     defeats one of the advantages of running the wrapper. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Portability Fix: IRIX complained with 'make clean' about *pure* (removed)
     [Jim Jagielski]
     
  *) Migration from sprintf() to snprintf() to avoid buffer
     overflows. [Marc Slemko]

  *) Provide portable snprintf() implementation (ap_snprintf)
     as well as *cvt family. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Portability Fix: NeXT lacks unistd.h so we wrap it's inclusion
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Remove mod_fastcgi.c from the distribution. This module appears
     to be maintained more through the Open Market channels and should
     continue to be easily available at http://www.fastcgi.com/

  *) Fixed bug in modules/Makefile that wouldn't allow building in more
     than one subdirectory (or cleaning, either). [Jeremy Laidman]

  *) mod_info assumed that the config files were relative to ServerRoot.
     [Ken the Rodent]

  *) CGI scripts called as an error document resulting from failed
     CGI execution would hang waiting for POST'ed data. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Log reason when mod_dir returns access HTTP_FORBIDDEN
     [Ken the Rodent]

  *) Properly check errno to prevent display of a directory index
     when server receives a long enough URL to confuse stat().
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Several security enhancements to suexec wrapper. It is _highly_
     recommended that previously installed versions of the wrapper
     be replaced with this version.  [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour]

	- ~user execution now properly restricted to ~user's home
	  directory and below.
	- execution restricted to UID/GID > 100
	- restrict passed environment to known variables
	- call setgid() before initgroups() (portability fix)
	- remove use of setenv() (portability fix)

  *) Add HTTP/1.0 response forcing. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add access control via environment variables. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add rflush() function. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) remove duplicate pcalloc() call in new_connection().

  *) Fix incorrect comparison which could allow number of children =
     MaxClients + 1 if less than HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. Also fix potential
     problem if StartServers > HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. [Ed Korthof]

  *) Updated support for OSes (MachTen, ULTRIX, Paragon, ISC, OpenBSD
     AIX PS/2, CONVEXOS. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Replace instances of inet_ntoa() with inet_addr() for ProxyBlock.
     It's more portable. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Replace references to make in Makefile.tmpl with $(MAKE).
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Add ProxyBlock directive w/IP address caching. Add IP address
     caching to NoCache directive as well. ProxyBlock works with all
     handlers; NoCache now also works with FTP for anonymous logins.
     Still more code cleanup. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Add "header parse" API hook [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix byte ordering problems for REMOTE_PORT [Chuck Murcko]

  *) suEXEC wrapper was freeing memory that had not been malloc'ed.

  *) Correctly allow access and auth directives in <Files> sections in
     server config files. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Fix bug with ServerPath that could cause certain files to be not
     found by the server. [Alexei Kosut] 

  *) Fix handling of ErrorDocument so that it doesn't remove a trailing
     double-quote from text and so that it properly checks for unsupported
     status codes using the new index_of_response interface. [Roy Fielding] 

  *) Multiple fixes to the lingering_close code in order to avoid being
     interrupted by a stray timeout, to avoid lingering on a connection
     that has already been aborted or never really existed, to ensure that
     we stop lingering as soon as any error condition is received, and to
     prevent being stuck indefinitely if the read blocks.  Also improves
     reporting of error conditions.  [Marc Slemko and Roy Fielding]

  *) Fixed initialization of parameter structure for sigaction.
     [mgyger@itr.ch, Adrian Filipi-Martin]

  *) Fixed reinitializing the parameters before each call to accept and
     select, and removed potential for infinite loop in accept.
     [Roy Fielding, after useful PR from adrian@virginia.edu]

  *) Fixed condition where, if a child fails to fork, the scoreboard would
     continue to say SERVER_STARTING forever. Eventually, the main process
     would refuse to start new children because count_idle_servers() will
     count those SERVER_STARTING entries and will always report that there
     are enough idle servers. [Phillip Vandry]

  *) Fixed bug in bcwrite regarding failure to account for partial writes.
     Avoided calling bflush() when the client is pipelining requests.
     Removed unnecessary flushes from http_protocol. [Dean Gaudet]
 
  *) Added description of "." mode in server-status [Jim Jagielski]


Changes with Apache 1.2b4:

  *) Fix possible race condition in accept_mutex_init() that
     could leave a small security hole open allowing files to be
     overwritten in cases where the server UID has write permissions.
     [Marc Slemko]

  *) Fix awk compatibilty problem in Configure. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix portablity problem in util_script where ARG_MAX may not be
     defined for some systems.

  *) Add changes to allow compilation on Machten 4.0.3 for PowerPC.
     [Randal Schwartz]

  *) OS/2 changes to support an MMAP style scoreboard file and UNIX
     style magic #! token for better script portability. [Garey Smiley]

  *) Fix bug in suexec wrapper introduced in b3 that would cause failed
     execution for ~userdir CGI. [Jason Dour]

  *) Fix initgroups() business in suexec wrapper. [Jason Dour]

  *) Fix month off by one in suexec wrapper logging.

Changes with Apache 1.2b3:

  *) Fix error in mod_cgi which could cause resources not to be properly
     freed, or worse. [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Fix find_string() NULL pointer dereference. [Howard Fear]

  *) Add set_flag_slot() at the request of Dirk and others.
     [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Sync mod_rewrite with patch level 10. [Ralf Engelschall]

  *) Add changes to improve the error message given for invalid
     ServerName parameters. [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Add "Authoritative" directive for Auth modules that don't
     currently have it. This gives admin control to assign authoritative
     control to an authentication scheme and allow "fall through" for
     those authentication modules that aren't "Authoritative" thereby
     allowing multiple authentication mechanisms to be chained.
     [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Remove requirement for ResourceConfig/AccessConfig if not using
     the three config file layout. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Add PASV mode to mod_proxy FTP handler. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Changes to suexec wrapper to fix the following problems:
     1.  symlinked homedirs will kill ~userdirs.
     2.  initgroups() on Linux 2.0.x clobbers gr->grid.
     3.  CGI command lines paramters problems
     4.  pw-pwdir for "docroot check" still the httpd user's pw record.
    [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour]

  *) Change create_argv() to accept variable arguments. This fixes
     a problem where arguments were not getting passed to the CGI via
     argv[] when the suexec wrapper was active. [Randy Terbush, Jake Buchholz]

  *) Collapse multiple slashes in path URLs to properly apply
     handlers defined by <Location>. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Define a sane set of DEFAULT_USER and DEFAULT_GROUP values for AIX.

  *) Improve the accuracy of request duration timings by setting
     r->request_time in read_request_line() instead of read_request().
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Reset timeout while reading via get_client_block() in mod_cgi.c
     Fixes problem with timed out transfers of large files. [Rasmus Lerdorf]

  *) Add the ability to pass different Makefile.tmpl files to Configure
     using the -make flag. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Fix coredump triggered when sending a SIGHUP to the server caused
     by an assertion failure, in turn caused by an uninitialised field in a
     listen_rec.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Add FILEPATH_INFO variable to CGI environment, which is equal to
     PATH_INFO from previous versions of Apache (in certain situations,
     Apache 1.2's PATH_INFO will be different than 1.1's). [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Add rwrite() function to API to allow for sending strings of
     arbitrary length. [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Remove rlim_t typedef for NetBSD. Do older versions need this?

  *) Defined rlim_t and WANTHSREGEX=yes and fixed waitpid() substitute for
     NeXT. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Removed recent modification to promote the status code on internal
     redirects, since the correct fix was to change the default log format
     in mod_log_config so that it outputs the original status. [Rob Hartill]

Changes with Apache 1.2b2:
  
  *) Update set_signals() to use sigaction() for setting handlers.
     This appears to fix a re-entrant problem in the seg_fault()
     bus_error() handlers. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Changes to allow mod_status compile for OS/2 [Garey Smiley]

  *) changes for DEC AXP running OSF/1 v3.0. [Marc Evans]

  *) proxy_http.c bugfixes:  [Chuck Murcko]
        1) fixes possible NULL pointer reference w/NoCache
        2) fixes NoCache behavior when using ProxyRemote (ProxyRemote
           host would cache nothing if it was in the local domain,
           and the local domain was in the NoCache list)
        3) Adds Host: header when not available
        4) Some code cleanup and clarification

  *) mod_include.c bugfixes:
	1) Fixed an ommission that caused include variables to not 
	   be parsed in config errmsg directives [Howard Fear]
	2) Remove HAVE_POSIX_REGEX cruft [Alexei Kosut]
	3) Patch to fix compiler warnings [perrot@lal.in2p3.fr]
	4) Allow backslash-escaping to all quoted text
	   [Ben Yoshino <ben@wiliki.eng.hawaii.edu>]
	5) Pass variable to command line if not set in XSSI's env
	   [Howard Fear]

  *) Fix infinite loop when processing Content-language lines in
     type-map files. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Closed file-globbing hole in test-cgi script. [Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Fixed problem in set_[user|group] that prevented CGI execution
     for non-virtualhosts when suEXEC was enabled. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Added PORTING information file.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Added definitions for S_IWGRP and S_IWOTH to conf.h [Ben Laurie]

  *) Changed default group to "nogroup" instead of "nobody" [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed define typo of FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT where
     USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT was intended.

  *) Fixed additional uses of 0xffffffff where INADDR_NONE was intended,
     which caused problems of systems where socket s_addr is >32bits.

  *) Added comment to explain (r->chunked = 1) side-effect in
     http_protocol.c [Roy Fielding]

  *) Replaced use of index() in mod_expires.c with more appropriate
     and portable isdigit() test.  [Ben Laurie]
  
  *) Updated Configure for ... 
	OS/2	      (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, other code changes)
        *-dg-dgux*    (bad pattern match)
        QNX           (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes)
        *-sunos4*     (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, -DUSEBCOPY)
        *-ultrix      (new)
	*-unixware211 (new)
     and added some user diagnostic info.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) In helpers/CutRule, replaced "cut" invocation with "awk" invocation
     for better portability. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Updated helpers/GuessOS for ... 
        SCO 5            (recognize minor releases)
        SCO Unixware     (braindamaged uname, whatever-whatever-unixware2)
	SCO UnixWare 2.1.1	(requires a separate set of #defines in conf.h)
        IRIX64           (-sgi-irix64)
        ULTRIX           (-unknown-ultrix)
        SINIX            (-whatever-sysv4)
        NCR Unix         (-ncr-sysv4)
     and fixed something in helpers/PrintPath  [Ben Laurie]

Changes with Apache 1.2b1:

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_2.html>

Changes with Apache 1.1.1:

  *) Fixed bug where Cookie module would make two entries in the
     logfile for each access [Mark Cox]

  *) Fixed bug where Redirect in .htaccess files would cause memory
     leak. [Nathan Neulinger]

  *) MultiViews now works correctly with AddHandler [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Problems with mod_auth_msql fixed [Dirk vanGulik]

  *) Fix misspelling of "Anonymous_Authorative" directive in mod_auth_anon.

Changes with Apache 1.1.0:

  *) Bring NeXT support up to date. [Takaaki Matsumoto]

  *) Bring QNX support up to date. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Make virtual hosts default to main server keepalive parameters.
     [Alexei Kosut, Ben Laurie]

  *) Allow ScanHTMLTitles to work with lowercase <title> tags. [Alexei Kosut]

     in mod_proxy. [Ben Laurie]

  *) mod_env now turned on by default in Configuration.tmpl.

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
        a) yet more mod_proxy bugs [Ben Laurie]
        b) CGI works again with inetd [Alexei Kosut]
	c) Leading colons were stripped from passwords [osm@interguide.com] 
	d) Another fix to multi-method Limit problem [jk@tools.de]

Changes with Apache 1.1b4:

  *) r->bytes_sent variable restored. [Robert Thau]

  *) Previously broken multi-method <Limit> parsing fixed. [Robert Thau]

  *) More possibly unsecure programs removed from the support directory.

  *) More mod_auth_msql authentication improvements.

  *) VirtualHosts based on Host: headers no longer conflict with the
     Listen directive.

  *) OS/2 compatibility enhancements. [Gary Smiley]

  *) POST now allowed to directory index CGI scripts.

  *) Actions now work with files of the default type.

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
        a) more mod_proxy bugs
        b) early termination of inetd requests
        c) compile warnings on several systems
        d) problems when scripts stop reading output early

Changes with Apache 1.1b3:

  *) Much of cgi-bin and all of cgi-src has been removed, due to
     various security holes found and that we could no longer support
     them.  

  *) The "Set-Cookie" header is now special-cased to not merge multiple 
     instances, since certain popular browsers can not handle multiple 
     Set-Cookie instructions in a single header. [Paul Sutton]

  *) rprintf() added to buffer code, occurrences of sprintf removed.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) CONNECT method for proxy module, which means tunneling SSL should work.
     (No crypto needed)  Also a NoCache config directive.

  *) Several API additions: pstrndup(), table_unset() and get_token()
     functions now available to modules.

  *) mod_imap fixups, in particular Location: headers are now complete
     URL's.

  *) New "info" module which reports on installed module set through a 
     special URL, a la mod_status.

  *) "ServerPath" directive added - allows for graceful transition
     for Host:-header-based virtual hosts.

  *) Anonymous authentication module improvements.

  *) MSQL authentication module improvements.

  *) Status module design improved - output now table-based. [Ben Laurie]

  *) htdigest utility included for use with digest authentication
     module.
 
  *) mod_negotiation: Accept values with wildcards to be treated with
     less priority than those without wildcards at the same quality
     value. [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Bugs which were fixed:
	a) numerous mod_proxy bugs
	b) CGI early-termination bug [Ben Laurie]
	c) Keepalives not working with virtual hosts
	d) RefererIgnore problems
	e) closing fd's twice in mod_include (causing core dumps on
	   Linux and elsewhere).

Changes with Apache 1.1b2:

  *) Bugfixes:
        a) core dumps in mod_digest
        b) truncated hostnames/ip address in the logs
        c) relative URL's in mod_imap map files

Changes with Apache 1.1b1:

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_1.html>

Changes with Apache 1.0.3:

  *) Internal redirects which occur in mod_dir.c now preserve the
     query portion of a request (the bit after the question mark).
     [Adam Sussman]

  *) Escape active characters '<', '>' and '&' in html output in
     directory listings, error messages and redirection links.
     [David Robinson]

  *) Apache will now work with LynxOS 2.3 and later [Steven Watt]

  *) Fix for POSIX compliance in waiting for processes in alloc.c.
     [Nick Williams]

  *) setsockopt no longer takes a const declared argument [Martijn Koster]

  *) Reset timeout timer after each successful fwrite() to the network.
     This patch adds a reset_timeout() procedure that is called by
     send_fd() to reset the timeout ever time data is written to the net.
     [Nathan Schrenk]

  *) timeout() signal handler now checks for SIGPIPE and reports
     lost connections in a more user friendly way. [Rob Hartill]

  *) Location of the "scoreboard" file which used to live in /tmp is
     now configurable (for OSes that can't use mmap) via ScoreBoardFile
     which works similar to PidFile (in httpd.conf) [Rob Hartill]

  *) Include sys/resource.h in the correct place for SunOS4 [Sameer Parekh]

  *) the pstrcat call in mod_cookies.c didn't have an ending NULL,
     which caused a SEGV with cookies enabled

  *) Output warning when MinSpareServers is set to <= 0 and change it to 1
     [Rob Hartill]

  *) Log the UNIX textual error returned by some system calls, in
     particular errors from accept() [David Robinson]

  *) Add strerror function to util.c for SunOS4 [Randy Terbush]

Changes with Apache 1.0.2

  *) patch to get Apache compiled on UnixWare 2.x, recommended as 
     a temporary measure, pending rewrite of rfc931.c. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Fix get_basic_auth_pw() to set the auth_type of the request.
     [David Robinson]

  *) past changes to http_config.c to only use the 
     setrlimit function on systems defining RLIMIT_NOFILE
     broke the feature on SUNOS4. Now defines HAVE_RESOURCE
     for SUNOS and prototypes the needed functions.

  *) Remove uses of MAX_STRING_LEN/HUGE_STRING_LEN from several routines.
     [David Robinson]

  *) Fix use of pointer to scratch memory. [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Merge multiple headers from CGI scripts instead of taking last
     one. [David Robinson]

  *) Add support for SCO 5. [Ben Laurie]

Changes with Apache 1.0.1

  *) Silence mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent if not configured
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Recursive includes can occur if the client supplies PATH_INFO data
     and the server provider uses relative links; as file.html
     relative to /doc.shtml/pathinfo is /doc.shtml/file.html. [David Robinson]

  *) The replacement for initgroups() did not call {set,end}grent(). This
     had two implications: if anything else used getgrent(), then
     initgroups() would fail, and it was consuming a file descriptor.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) On heavily loaded servers it was possible for the scoreboard to get 
     out of sync with reality, as a result of a race condition.
     The observed symptoms are far more Apaches running than should
     be, and heavy system loads, generally followed by catastrophic
     system failure. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix typo in license. [David Robinson]

Changes with Apache 1.0.0

  *) Not listed. See <http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_0.html>

Changes with Apache 0.8.16

  *) New man page for 'httpd' added to support directory [David Robinson]

  *) .htgroup files can have more than one line giving members for a
     given group (each must have the group name in front), for NCSA
     back-compatibility [Robert Thau]

  *) Mutual exclusion around accept() is on by default for SVR4 systems
     generally, since they generally can't handle multiple processes in
     accept() on the same socket.  This should cure flaky behavior on
     a lot of those systems.  [David Robinson]

  *) AddType, AddEncoding, and AddLanguage directives take multiple
     extensions on a single command line [David Robinson]

  *) UserDir can be disabled for a given virtual host by saying
     "UserDir disabled" in the <VirtualHost> section --- it was a bug
     that this didn't work.  [David Robinson]

  *) Compiles on QNX [Ben Laurie]

  *) Corrected parsing of ctime time format [David Robinson]

  *) httpd does a perror() before exiting if it can't log its pid
     to the PidFile, to make diagnosing the error a bit easier.
     [David Robinson]

  *) <!--#include file="..."--> can no longer include files in the
     parent directory, for NCSA back-compatibility.  [David Robinson]

  *) '~' is *not* escaped in URIs generated for directory listings
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Eliminated compiler warning in the imagemap module [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed bug involving handling URIs with escaped %-characters
     in redirects [David Robinson]

Changes with Apache 0.8.15

  *) Switched to new, simpler license

  *) Eliminated core dumps with improperly formatted DBM group files [Mark Cox]

  *) Don't allow requests for ordinary files to have PATH_INFO [Ben Laurie]

  *) Reject paths containing %-escaped '%' or null characters [David Robinson]

  *) Correctly handles internal redirects to files with names containing '%'
     [David Robinson]

  *) Repunctuated some error messages [Aram Mirzadeh, Andrew Wilson]

  *) Use geteuid() rather than getuid() to see if we have root privilege,
     so that server correctly resets privilege if run setuid root.  [Andrew
     Wilson]

  *) Handle ftp: and telnet: URLs correctly in imagemaps (built-in module)
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Fix relative URLs in imagemap files [Randy Terbush]

  *) Somewhat better fix for the old "Alias /foo/ /bar/" business
     [David Robinson]

  *) Don't repeatedly open the ErrorLog if a bunch of <VirtualHost>
     entries all name the same one. [David Robinson]

  *) Fix directory listings with filenames containing unusual characters
     [David Robinson]

  *) Better URI-escaping for generated URIs in directories with filenames
     containing unusual characters [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fixed potential FILE* leak in http_main.c [Ben Laurie]

  *) Unblock alarms on error return from spawn_child() [David Robinson]  

  *) Sample Config files have extra note for SCO users [Ben Laurie]

  *) Configuration has note for HP-UX users [Rob Hartill]

  *) Eliminated some bogus Linux-only #defines in conf.h [Aram Mirzadeh]

  *) Nuked bogus #define in httpd.h [David Robinson]

  *) Better test for whether a system has setrlimit() [David Robinson]

  *) Calls update_child_status() after reopen_scoreboard() [David Robinson]

  *) Doesn't send itself SIGHUP on startup when run in the -X debug-only mode
     [Ben Laurie]

Changes with Apache 0.8.14

  *) Compiles on SCO ODT 3.0 [Ben Laurie]

  *) AddDescription works (better) [Ben Laurie]

  *) Leaves an intelligible error diagnostic when it can't set group
     privileges on standalone startup [Andrew Wilson]

  *) Compiles on NeXT again --- the 0.8.13 RLIMIT patch was failing on
     that machine, which claims to be BSD but does not support RLIMIT.
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) gcc -Wall no longer complains about an unused variable when util.c
     is compiled with -DMINIMAL_DNS [Andrew Wilson]

  *) Nuked another compiler warning for -Wall on Linux [Aram Mirzadeh]

Changes with Apache 0.8.13

  *) Make IndexIgnore *work* (ooops) [Jarkko Torppa]

  *) Have built-in imagemap code recognize & honor Point directive [James
     Cloos]

  *) Generate cleaner directory listings in directories with a mix of
     long and short filenames [Rob Hartill]

  *) Properly initialize dynamically loaded modules [Royston Shufflebotham]

  *) Properly default ServerName for virtual servers [Robert Thau]

  *) Rationalize handling of BSD in conf.h and elsewhere [Randy Terbush,
     Paul Richards and a cast of thousands...]

  *) On self-identified BSD systems (we don't try to guess any more),
     allocate a few extra file descriptors per virtual host with setrlimit,
     if we can, to avoid running out. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Write 22-character lock file name into buffer with enough space
     on startup [Konstantin Olchanski]

  *) Use archaic setpgrp() interface on NeXT, which requires it [Brian
     Pinkerton]

  *) Suppress -Wall warning by casting const away in util.c [Aram Mirzadeh]

  *) Suppress -Wall warning by initializing variable in negotiation code
     [Tobias Weingartner]

Changes with Apache 0.8.12

  *) Doesn't pause three seconds after including a CGI script which is
     too slow to die off (this is done by not even trying to kill off
     subprocesses, including the SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine, until
     after the entire document has been processed).  [Robert Thau]

  *) Doesn't do SSI if Options Includes is off.  (Ooops).  [David Robinson]

  *) Options IncludesNoExec allows inclusion of at least text/* [Roy Fielding]

  *) Allows .htaccess files to override <Directory> sections naming the
     same directory [David Robinson]

  *) Removed an efficiency hack in sub_req_lookup_uri which was
     causing certain extremely marginal cases (e.g., ScriptAlias of a
     *particular* index.html file) to fail.  [David Robinson]

  *) Doesn't log an error when the requested URI requires
     authentication, but no auth header line was supplied by the
     client; this is a normal condition (the client doesn't no auth is
     needed here yet).  [Robert Thau]

  *) Behaves more sanely when the name server loses its mind [Sean Welch]

  *) RFC931 code compiles cleanly on old BSDI releases [Randy Terbush]

  *) RFC931 code no longer passes out name of prior clients on current
     requests if the current request came from a server that doesn't
     do RFC931.  [David Robinson]

  *) Configuration script accepts "Module" lines with trailing whitespace.
     [Robert Thau]

  *) Cleaned up compiler warning from mod_access.c [Robert Thau]

  *) Cleaned up comments in mod_cgi.c [Robert Thau]

Changes with Apache 0.8.11

  *) Wildcard <Directory> specifications work.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Doesn't loop for buggy CGI on Solaris [Cliff Skolnick]
  
  *) Symlink checks (FollowSymLinks off, or SymLinkIfOwnerMatch) always check
     the file being requested itself, in addition to the directories leading
     up to it. [Robert Thau]
  
  *) Logs access failures due to symlink checks or invalid client address
     in the error log [Roy Fielding, Robert Thau]
  
  *) Symlink checks deal correctly with systems where lstat of
     "/path/to/some/link/" follows the link.  [Thau, Fielding]

  *) Doesn't reset DirectoryIndex to 'index.html' when
     other directory options are set in a .htaccess file.  [Robert Thau]
  
  *) Clarified init code and nuked bogus warning in mod_access.c
     [Florent Guillaume]
  
  *) Corrected several directives in sample srm.conf
     --- includes corrections to directory indexing icon-related directives
     (using unknown.gif rather than unknown.xbm as the DefaultIcon, doing
     icons for encodings right, and turning on AddEncoding by default).
     [Roy Fielding]
  
  *) Corrected descriptions of args to AddIcon and AddAlt in command table
     [James Cloos]
  
  *) INSTALL & README mention "contributed modules" directory [Brian
     Behlendorf]
  
  *) Fixed English in the license language...  "for for" --> "for".
     [Roy Fielding]
  
  *) Fixed ScriptAlias/Alias interaction by moving ScriptAlias handling to
     mod_alias.c, merging it almost completely with handling of Alias, and
     adding a 'notes' field to the request_rec which allows the CGI module
     to discover whether the Alias module has put this request through
     ScriptAlias (which it needs to know for back-compatibility, as the old
     NCSA code did not check Options ExecCGI in ScriptAlias directories).
     [Robert Thau]
  

Changes with Apache 0.8.10

  *) AllowOverride applies to the named directory, and not just
     subdirectories.  [David Robinson]

  *) Do locking for accept() exclusion (on systems that need it)
     using a special file created for the purpose in /usr/tmp, and
     not the error log; using the error log causes real problems
     if it's NFS-mounted; this is known to be the cause of a whole
     lot of "server hang" problems with Solaris.  [David Robinson;
     thanks to Merten Schumann for help diagnosing the problem].

Changes with Apache 0.8.9

  *) Compiles with -DMAXIMUM_DNS ---- ooops! [Henrik Mortensen]

  *) Nested includes see environment variables of the including document,
     for NCSA bug-compatibility (some sites have standard footer includes
     which try to print out the last-modified date).  [Eric Hagberg/Robert
     Thau]

  *) <!--exec cgi="/some/uri/here"--> always treats the item named by the
     URI as a CGI script, even if it would have been treated as something
     else if requested directly, for NCSA back-compatibility.  (Note that
     this means that people who know the name of the script can see the
     code just by asking for it).  [Robert Thau]

  *) New version of dbmmanage script included in support directory as
     dbmmanage.new.

  *) Check if scoreboard file couldn't be opened, and say so, rather
     then going insane [David Robinson]

  *) POST to CGI works on A/UX [Jim Jaglieski]

  *) AddIcon and AddAlt commands work properly [Rob Hartill]

  *) NCSA server push works properly --- the Arena bug compatibility
     workaround, which broke it, is gone (use -DARENA_BUG_WORKAROUND
     if you still want the workaround).  [Rob Hartill]

  *) If client didn't submit any Accept-encodings, ignore encodings in
     content negotiation.  (NB this will all have to be reworked anyway
     for the new HTTP draft).  [Florent Guillaume]
     
  *) Don't dump core when trying to log timed-out requests [Jim Jaglieski]

  *) Really honor CacheNegotiatedDocs [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Give Redirect priority over Alias, for NCSA bug compatibility
     [David Robinson]

  *) Correctly set PATH_TRANSLATED in all cases from <!--#exec cmd=""-->,
     paralleling earlier bug fix for CGI [David Robinson]

  *) If DBM auth is improperly configured, report a server error and don't
     dump core.

  *) Deleted FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPTS from conf.h entry for A/UX;
     it seems to work well enough without it (even in a 10 hits/sec
     workout), and the overhead for the locking under A/UX is
     alarmingly high (though it is very low on other systems).
     [Eric Hagberg]

  *) Fixed portability problems with mod_cookies.c [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Further de-Berklize mod_cookies.c; change the bogus #include.  [Brian
     Behlendorf/Eric Hagberg]

  *) More improvements to default Configuration for A/UX [Jim Jaglieski]

  *) Compiles clean on NEXT [Rob Hartill]

  *) Compiles clean on SGI [Robert Thau]

Changes with Apache 0.8.8

  *) SunOS library prototypes now never included unless explicitly
     requested in the configuration (via -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES);
     people using GNU libc on SunOS are screwed by prototypes for the
     standard library.

     (Those who wish to compile clean with gcc -Wall on a standard
     SunOS setup need the prototypes, and may obtain them using
     -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES.  Those wishing to use -Wall on a system
     with nonstandard libraries are presumably competent to make their
     own arrangements).

  *) Strips trailing '/' characters off both args to the Alias command,
     to make 'Alias /foo/ /bar/' work.

Changes with Apache 0.8.7

  *) Don't hang when restarting with a child from 'TransferLog "|..."' running
     [reported by David Robinson]

  *) Compiles clean on OSF/1 [David Robinson]

  *) Added some of the more recent significant changes (AddLanguage stuff,
     experimental LogFormat support) to CHANGES file in distribution root
     directory

Changes with Apache 0.8.6

  *) Deleted Netscape reload workaround --- it's in violation of HTTP specs.
     (If you actually wanted a conditional GET which bypassed the cache, you
     couldn't get it). [Reported by Roy Fielding]

  *) Properly terminate headers on '304 Not Modified' replies to conditional
     GETs --- no browser we can find cares much, but the CERN proxy chokes.
     [Reported by Cliff Skolnick; fix discovered independently by Rob Hartill]

  *) httpd -v doesn't call itself "Shambhala".  [Reported by Chuck Murcko]

  *) SunOS lib-function prototypes in conf.h conditionalized on __GNUC__,
     not __SUNPRO_C (they're needed to quiet gcc -Wall, but acc chokes on 'em,
     and older versions don't set the __SUNPRO_C preprocessor variable).  On
     all other systems, these are never used anyway.  [Reported by Mark Cox].

  *) Scoreboard file (/tmp/htstatus.*) no longer publically writable.

Changes with Apache 0.8.5

  *) Added last-minute configurable log experiment, as optional module

  *) Correctly set r->bytes_sent for HTTP/0.9 requests, so they get logged
     properly.  (One-line fix to http_protocol.c).

  *) Work around bogus behavior when reloading from Netscape.
     It's Netscape's bug --- for some reason they expect a request with
     If-modified-since: to not function as a conditional GET if it also
     comes with Pragma: no-cache, which is way out of line with the HTTP
     spec (according to Roy Fielding, the redactor).  

  *) Added parameter to set maximum number of server processes.  

  *) Added patches to make it work on A/UX.  A/UX is *weird*.  [Eric Hagberg]

  *) IdentityCheck bugfix [Chuck Murcko].

  *) Corrected cgi-src/Makefile entry for new imagemap script.  [Alexei Kosut]

  *) More sample config file corrections; add extension to AddType for
     *.asis, move AddType generic description to its proper place, and
     fix miscellaneous typos. [ Alexei Kosut ]

  *) Deleted the *other* reference to the regents from the Berkeley
     legal disclaimer (everyplace).

  *) Nuked Shambhala name from src/README; had already cleaned it out
     of everywhere else.

Changes with Apache 0.8.4

  *) Changes to server-pool management parms --- renamed current
     StartServers to MinSpareServers, created separate StartServers
     parameter which means what it says, and renamed MaxServers to
     MaxSpareServers (though the old name still works, for NCSA 1.4
     back-compatibility).  The old names were generally regarded as
     too confusing.  Also altered "docs" in sample config files.

  *) More improvements to default config files ---
     sample directives (commented out) for XBitHack, BindAddress,
     CacheNegotiatedDocs, VirtualHost; decent set of AddLanguage
     defaults, AddTypes for send-as-is and imagemap magic types, and
     improvements to samples for DirectoryIndex [Alexei Kosut]

  *) Yet more improvements to default config files --- changes to
     Alexei's sample AddLanguage directives, and sample LanguagePriority
     [ Florent Guillaume ]

  *) Set config file locations properly if not set in httpd.conf
     [ David Robinson ]

  *) Don't escape URIs in internal redirects multiple times; don't
     do that when translating PATH_INFO to PATH_TRANSLATED either.
     [ David Robinson ]

  *) Corrected spelling of "Required" in 401 error reports [Andrew Wilson]

Changes with Apache 0.8.3

  *) Edited distribution README to *briefly* summarize installation
     procedures, and give a pointer to the INSTALL file in the src/
     directory.

  *) Upgraded imagemap script in cgi-bin to 1.8 version from more
     recent NCSA distributions.

  *) Bug fix to previous bug fix --- if .htaccess file and <Directory>
     exist for the same directory, use both and don't segfault.  [Reported
     by David Robinson]

  *) Proper makefile dependencies [David Robinson]

  *) Note (re)starts in error log --- reported by Rob Hartill.

  *) Only call no2slash() after get_path_info() has been done, to
     preserve multiple slashes in the PATH_INFO [NCSA compatibility,
     reported by Andrew Wilson, though this one is probably a real bug]

  *) Fixed mod_imap.c --- relative paths with base_uri referer don't
     dump core when Referer is not supplied. [Randy Terbush]

  *) Lightly edited sample config files to refer people to our documentation
     instead of NCSA's, and to list Rob McCool as *original* author (also
     deleted his old, and no doubt non-functional email address).  Would be
     nice to have examples of new features...

Changes with Apache 0.8.2

  *) Added AddLanuage code [Florent Guillaume]

  *) Don't say "access forbidden" when a CGI script is not found.  [Mark Cox] 

  *) All sorts of problems when MultiViews finds a directory.  It would
     be nice if mod_dir.c was robust enough to handle that, but for now,
     just punt.  [reported by Brian Behlendorf]

  *) Wait for all children on restart, to make sure that the old socket
     is gone and we can reopen it.  [reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Imagemap module is enabled in default Configuration 

  *) RefererLog and UserAgentLog modules properly default the logfile
     [Randy Terbush]

  *) Mark Cox's mod_cookies added to the distribution as an optional
     module (commented out in the default Configuration, and noted as
     an experiment, along with mod_dld). [Mark Cox]

  *) Compiles on Ultrix (a continuing battle...). [Robert Thau]

  *) Fixed nasty bug in SIGTERM handling [reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Changed "Shambhala" to "Apache" in API docs. [Robert Thau]

  *) Added new, toothier legal disclaimer. [Robert Thau; copied from BSD
     license]

Changes with Apache 0.8.1

  *) New imagemap module [Randy Terbush]

  *) Replacement referer log module with NCSA-compatible RefererIgnore
     [Matthew Gray again]

  *) Don't mung directory listings with very long filenames.
     [Florent Guillaume]

Changes with Apache 0.8.0 (nee Shambhala 0.6.2):

  *) New config script.  See INSTALL for info.  [Robert Thau]

  *) Scoreboard mechanism for regulating the number of extant server
     processes.  MaxServers and StartServers defaults are the same as
     for NCSA, but the meanings are slightly different.  (Actually,
     I should probably lower the MaxServers default to 10).

     Before asking for a new connection, each server process checks
     the number of other servers which are also waiting for a
     connection.  If there are more than MaxServers, it quietly dies
     off.  Conversely, every second, the root, or caretaker, process
     looks to see how many servers are waiting for a new connection;
     if there are fewer than StartServers, it starts a new one.  This
     does not depend on the number of server processes already extant.
     The accounting is arranged through a "scoreboard" file, named
     /tmp/htstatus.*, on which each process has an independent file
     descriptor (they need to seek without interference).

     The end effect is that MaxServers is the maximum number of
     servers on an *inactive* server machine, but more will be forked
     off to handle unusually heavy loads (or unusually slow clients);
     these will die off when they are no longer needed --- without
     reverting to the overhead of full forking operation.  There is a
     hard maximum of 150 server processes compiled in, largely to
     avoid forking out of control and dragging the machine down.
     (This is arguably too high).

     In my server endurance tests, this mechanism did not appear to
     impose any significant overhead, even after I forced it to put the
     scoreboard file on a normal filesystem (which might have more
     overhead than tmpfs).  [Robert Thau]
   
  *) Set HTTP_FOO variables for SSI <!--#exec cmd-->s, not just CGI scripts.
     [Cliff Skolnick]

  *) Read .htaccess files even in directory with <Directory> section.
     (Former incompatibility noted on mailing list, now fixed). [Robert
     Thau]

  *) "HEAD /" gives the client a "Bad Request" error message, rather
     than trying to send no body *and* no headers.  [Cliff Skolnick].

  *) Don't produce double error reports for some very obscure cases
     mainly involving auth configuration (the "all modules decline to
     handle" case which is a sure sign of a server bug in most cases,
     but also happens when authentication is badly misconfigured).
     [Robert Thau]

  *) Moved FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT defines into conf.h (that's what
     it's *for*, and this sort of thing really shouldn't be cluttering
     up the Makefile). [Robert Thau]

  *) Incidental code cleanups in http_main.c --- stop dragging
     sa_client around; just declare it where used.  [Robert Thau]
  
  *) Another acc-related fix.  (It doesn't like const char
     in some places...). [Mark Cox]

Changes with 0.6.1

  *) Fixed auth_name-related typos in http_core.c [Brian Behlendorf]
     Also, fixed auth typo in http_protocol.c unmasked by this fix.

  *) Compiles clean with acc on SunOS [Paul Sutton]

  *) Reordered modules in modules.c so that Redirect takes priority
     over ScriptAlias, for NCSA bug-compatibility [Rob Hartill] ---
     believe it or not, he has an actual site with a ScriptAlias and
     a Redirect declared for the *exact same directory*.  Even *my*
     compatibility fetish wouldn't motivate me to fix this if the fix
     required any effort, but it doesn't, so what the hey. 

  *) Fixed to properly default several server_rec fields for virtual
     servers from the corresponding fields in the main server_rec.
     [Cliff Skolnick --- 'port' was a particular irritant].

  *) No longer kills off nph- child processes before they are
     finished sending output. [Matthew Gray]

Changes with 0.6.0

  *) Two styles of timeout --- hard and soft.  soft_timeout()s just put
     the connection to the client in an "aborted" state, but otherwise
     allow whatever handlers are running to clean up.  hard_timeout()s
     abort the request in progress completely; anything not tied to some
     resource pool cleanup will leak.  They're still around because I
     haven't yet come up with a more elegant way of handling
     timeouts when talking to something that isn't the client.  The
     default_handler and the dir_handler now use soft timeouts, largely
     so I can test the feature.  [Robert Thau]

  *) TransferLog "| my_postprocessor ..." seems to be there.  Note that
     the case of log handlers dying prematurely is probably handled VERY
     gracelessly at this point, and if the logger stops reading input,
     the server will hang.  (It is known to correctly restart the
     logging process on server restart; this is (should be!) going through
     the same SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine used to ding an errant CGI
     script).  [Robert Thau]

  *) asis files supported (new module).  [Robert Thau]

  *) IdentityCheck code is compiled in, but has not been tested.  (I
     don't know anyone who runs identd). [Robert Thau]

  *) PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED are not set unless some real PATH_INFO
     came in with the request, for NCSA bug-compatibility. [Robert Thau]

  *) Don't leak the DIR * on HEAD request for a directory. [Robert Thau]

  *) Deleted the block_alarms() stuff from dbm_auth; no longer necessary,
     as timeouts are not in scope. [Robert Thau]

  *) quoted-string args in config files now handled correctly (doesn't drop
     the last character). [Robert Thau; reported by Randy Terbush]

  *) Fixed silly typo in http_main.c which was suddenly fatal in HP-UX.
     How the hell did it ever work? [Robert Thau; reported by Rob Hartill]

  *) mod_core.c --- default_type returns DEFAULT_TYPE (the compile-time
     default default type); the former default default behavior when all
     type-checkers defaulted had been a core dump.  [Paul Sutton]

  *) Copy filenames out of the struct dirent when indexing
     directories.  (On Linux, readdir() returns a pointer to the same
     memory area every time).  Fix is in mod_dir.c.  [Paul Sutton]

Changes with 0.5.3 [not released]

  *) Default response handler notes "file not found" in the error log,
     if the file was not found.  [Cliff Skolnick].

  *) Another Cliff bug --- "GET /~user" now properly redirects (the userdir
     code no longer sets up bogus PATH_INFO which fakes out the directory
     handler). [Cliff Skolnick]

Changes with 0.5.2

  *) Changes to http_main.c --- root server no longer plays silly
     games with SIGCHLD, and so now detects and replaces dying
     children.  Child processes just die on SIGTERM, without taking
     the whole process group with them.  Potential problem --- if any
     child process refuses to die, we hang in restart.
     MaxRequestsPerChild may still not work, but it certainly works
     better than it did before this!  [Robert Thau]

  *) mod_dir.c bug fixes: ReadmeName and HeaderName
     work (or work better, at least); over-long description lines
     properly terminated. [Mark Cox]

  *) http_request.c now calls unescape_url() more places where it
     should [Paul Sutton].

  *) More directory handling bugs (reported by Cox)
     Parent Directory link is now set correctly. [Robert Thau]

Changes with 0.5.1: [Hopefully complete]

  *) Generalized cleanup interface in alloc.c --- any function can be
     registered with alloc.c as a cleanup for a resource pool;
     tracking of files and file descriptors has been reimplemented in
     terms of this interface, so I can give it some sort of a test.
     [Robert Thau]

  *) More changes in alloc.c --- new cleanup_for_exec() function,
     which tracks down and closes all file descriptors which have been
     registered with the alloc.c machinery before the server exec()s a
     child process for CGI or <!--#exec-->.  CGI children now get
     started with exactly three file descriptors open.  Hopefully,
     this cures the problem Rob H. was having with overly persistent
     CGI connections. [Robert Thau]

  *) Mutual exclusion around the accept() in child_main() --- this is
     required on at least SGI, Solaris and Linux, and is #ifdef'ed in
     by default on those systems only (-DFCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT).
     This uses fcntl(F_SETLK,...) on the error log descriptor because
     flock() on that descriptor won't work on systems which have BSD
     flock() semantics, including (I think) Linux 1.3 and Solaris.

     This does work on SunOS (when the server is idle, only one
     process in the pool is waiting on accept()); it *ought* to work
     on the other systems. [Robert Thau]

  *) FreeBSD and BSDI portability tweaks [Chuck Murcko]

  *) sizeof(*sa_client) bugfix from [Rob Hartill]

  *) pstrdup(..., NULL) returns NULL, [Randy Terbush]

  *) block_alarms() to avoid leaking the DBM* in dbm auth (this should
     be unnecessary if I go to the revised timeout-handling scheme).
     [Robert Thau]

  *) For NCSA bug-compatibility, set QUERY_STRING env var (to a null
     string) even if none came in with the request.  [Robert Thau]

  *) CHANGES file added to distribution ;-).
