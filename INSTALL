  APACHE INSTALLATION

  Introduction
  ============

  Apache 2.0's configuration and installation environment has changed
  completely from Apache 1.3.  Apache 1.3 used a custom set of scripts
  to achieve easy installation.  Apache 2.0 now uses libtool and autoconf
  to create an environment that looks like many other Open Source projects.


  Installing the Apache 1.3 HTTP server with APACI
  ================================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ ./buildconf
     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start

     NOTE: PREFIX is not the string "PREFIX". Instead use the Unix
           filesystem path under which Apache should be installed. For
           instance use "/usr/local/apache" for PREFIX above.

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for building Apache:

     o  Disk Space: 

        Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk space
        available.  After installation Apache occupies approximately 5 MB of
        disk space (the actual required disk space depends on the amount of
        compiled in third party modules, etc).

     o  ANSI-C Compiler: 

        Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
        (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version
        2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
        vendors compiler is ANSI compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU
        at http://www.gnu.org/ and the GCC distribution under
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html .

     o  Libtool 1.3.3:

        Make sure that you have libtool 1.3.3 or later installed before
        trying to configure and build Apache 2.0.  Libtool can be downloaded
        from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), at 
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.

     o  Autoconf 2.13:

        Make sure that you have autoconf 2.13 or later installed before
        trying to configure and build Apache 2.0.  Autoconf can be
        downloaded from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), at
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.

     o  Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:

        For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage' (which are
        written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions 5.003
        and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is found by APACI's
        `configure' script this is no harm.  Of course, you still can build
        and install Apache 1.3. Only those support scripts cannot be used. If
        you have multiple Perl interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from
        the vendor and a Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use
        the --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is
        selected by APACI.

     o  Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:

        To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load modules
        under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the pragmatic
        dlopen()/dlsym() system calls. These system calls are not available
        under all operating systems therefore you cannot use the DSO mechanism
        on all platforms. And Apache currently has only limited built-in
        knowledge on how to compile shared objects because this is heavily
        platform-dependent. The current state is this:

        o Out-of-the-box supported platforms are (Not all of these will
          work currently.  DSO support is currently available on most
          of these platforms however):
           - Linux     - SunOS         - UnixWare     - Darwin/Mac OS
           - FreeBSD   - Solaris       - AIX          - OpenStep/Mach
           - OpenBSD   - IRIX          - SCO          - DYNIX/ptx
           - NetBSD    - HPUX          - ReliantUNIX
           - BSDI      - Digital Unix  - DGUX

        o Entirely unsupported platforms are:
           - Ultrix

        If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler and
        linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT
        below) manually or at least make sure a Perl 5 interpreter is
        installed from which Apache can guess the options.

  3. Configuring the source tree
     ---------------------------

     Setup:
 
     The first step in compiling Apache 2.0 is to setup the source tree so
     that it can be built.  This is done by running:
 
     ./buildconf

     This script ensures that all required programs are installed on the
     currently machine, and creates the ./configure script.  If you are
     using a package downloaded from apache.org then this step is not 
     necessary.

     Introduction:

     The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your particular
     platform and personal requirements. The most important setup here is the
     location prefix where Apache is to be installed later, because Apache has
     to be configured for this location to work correctly. But there are a lot
     of other options available for your pleasure.

     For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a typical
     example which compiles Apache for the installation tree /sw/pkg/apache
     with a particular compiler and flags plus the two additional modules
     mod_rewrite and mod_speling for later loading through the DSO mechanism: 

     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
                   --enable-rewrite=shared \
                   --enable-speling=shared

     The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags for Apache 2.0
     is to run ./configure --help.  What follows is a brief description of
     most of the arguments.

     Reference:

     $ [CC=...]        [CFLAGS_SHLIB=...]           [TARGET=...]

                             [--sysconfdir=DIR]        
                             [--datadir=DIR]           
                             [--includedir=DIR]        
                             [--localstatedir=DIR]
                             [--runtimedir=DIR]        [--enable-suexec]
                             [--logfiledir=DIR]        [--suexec-caller=UID]
                             [--proxycachedir=DIR]     [--suexec-docroot=DIR]
                             [--with-layout=[FILE:]ID] [--suexec-logfile=FILE]
                                                       [--suexec-userdir=DIR]
                             [--with-perl=FILE]        [--suexec-uidmin=UID]
                             [--without-support]       [--suexec-gidmin=GID]
                             [--without-confadjust]    [--suexec-safepath=PATH]
                             [--without-execstrip]
			     [--server-uid=UID]        [--with-maintainter-mode]
			     [--server-gid=GID]

     Use the CC, OPTIM, CFLAGS, INCLUDES, LDFLAGS, LIBS, CFLAGS_SHLIB,
     LD_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT, RANLIB, DEPS and TARGET
     environment variables to override the corresponding default entries in
     the src/Configuration.tmpl file (see there for more information about
     their usage).

     Use the --prefix=PREFIX and --exec-prefix=EPREFIX options to configure
     Apache to use a particular installation prefix. The default is
     PREFIX=/usr/local/apache and EPREFIX=PREFIX.

     Use the --bindir=DIR, --sbindir=DIR, --libexecdir=DIR, --mandir=DIR,
     --sysconfdir=DIR, --datadir=DIR, --includedir=DIR, --localstatedir=DIR,
     --runtimedir=DIR, --logfiledir=DIR and proxycachedir=DIR option to change
     the paths for particular subdirectories of the installation tree.
     Defaults are bindir=EPREFIX/bin, sbindir=EPREFIX/sbin,
     libexecdir=EPREFIX/libexec, mandir=PREFIX/man, sysconfdir=PREFIX/etc,
     datadir=PREFIX/share, includedir=PREFIX/include,
     localstatedir=PREFIX/var, runtimedir=PREFIX/var/run,
     logfiledir=PREFIX/var/log and proxycachedir=PREFIX/var/proxy.

         Note: To reduce the pollution of shared installation locations
               (like /usr/local/ or /etc) with Apache files to a minimum the
               string ``/apache'' is automatically appended to 'libexecdir',
               'sysconfdir', 'datadir', 'localstatedir' and 'includedir' if
               (and only if) the following points apply for each path
               individually:

                   1. the path doesn't already contain the word ``apache''
                   2. the path was not directly customized by the user

               Keep in mind that per default these paths are derived from
               'prefix' and 'exec-prefix', so usually its only a matter
               whether these paths contain ``apache'' or not. Although the
               defaults were defined with experience in mind you always should
               make sure the paths fit your situation by checking the finally
               chosen paths via the --layout option.

     Use the --with-layout=[F:]ID option to select a particular installation
     path base-layout. You always _HAVE_ to select a base-layout. There are
     currently two layouts pre-defined in the file config.layout: `Apache' for
     the classical Apache path layout and `GNU' for a path layout conforming
     to the GNU `standards' document. When you want to use your own custom
     layout FOO, either add a corresponding "<Layout FOO>...</Layout>" section
     to config.layout and use --with-layout=FOO or place it into your own
     file, say config.mypaths, and use --with-layout=config.mypaths:FOO.
 
     Use the --show-layout option to check the final installation path layout
     while fiddling with the options above.
 
     Use the --enable-rule=NAME and --disable-rule=NAME options to enable or
     disable a particular Rule from the Apache src/Configuration.tmpl file. The
     defaults (yes=enabled, no=disabled) can either be seen when running
     `./configure --help' or manually looked up in the src/Configuration.tmpl
     file.
 
     Use the --enable-NAME=(shared) and --disable-NAME options to enable
     or disable a particular already distributed module from the Apache
     package.

     Use the --with-mpm=NAME option to determine which MPM should be built
     for your server.

                    (-) = disabled per default [enable  with --enable-module ]

     Use the --enable-suexec option to enable the suEXEC feature by building
     and installing the "suexec" support program. Use --suexec-caller=UID to
     set the allowed caller user id, --suexec-userdir=DIR to set the user
     subdirectory, --suexec-docroot=DIR to set the suexec root directory,
     --suexec-uidmin=UID/--suexec-gidmin=GID to set the minimal allowed
     UID/GID, --suexec-logfile=FILE to set the logfile and
     --suexec-safepath=PATH to set the safe shell PATH for the suEXEC
     feature. At least one --suexec-xxxxx option has to be provided together
     with the --enable-suexec option to let APACI accept your request for
     using the suEXEC feature.

     CAUTION: FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE SUEXEC FEATURE WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO
              FIRST READ THE DOCUMENT htdocs/manual/suexec.html BEFORE USING
              THE ABOVE OPTIONS.
     
              USING THE SUEXEC FEATURE PROPERLY CAN REDUCE CONSIDERABLY THE
              SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED WITH ALLOWING USERS TO DEVELOP AND RUN
              PRIVATE CGI OR SSI PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, IF SUEXEC IS IMPROPERLY
              CONFIGURED, IT CAN CAUSE ANY NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY
              CREATE NEW HOLES IN YOUR COMPUTER'S SECURITY.  IF YOU AREN'T
              FAMILIAR WITH MANAGING SETUID ROOT PROGRAMS AND THE SECURITY
              ISSUES THEY PRESENT, WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU NOT CONSIDER
              USING SUEXEC AND KEEP AWAY FROM THESE OPTIONS!

     Use the --shadow option to let APACI create a shadow source tree of the
     sources for building. This is useful when you want to build for different
     platforms in parallel (usually through a NFS, AFS or DFS mounted
     filesystem).  You may specify a directory to the --shadow option into
     which the shadow tree will be created.
 
     Use the --quiet option to disable all configuration verbose messages.
 
     Use the --verbose option to enable additional verbose messages.
     
     Use the --server-uid option to specify the user ID you want the server to run
     as. If not specified the server will run as user nobody.  If the user ID
     specified is different than the ID of the user starting the server, you need to
     start the server as root.

     Use the --server-gid option to specify the group ID you want the server user ID to
     be a member of.  If not specified, the group ID will be #-1.

  4. Building the package
     --------------------
     
     Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
     simply running the command
 
        $ make 
 
     Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete
     under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependend on the amount of
     modules you have enabled. 
 
  5. Installing the package
     ----------------------
     
     Now its time to install the package under the configured installation
     PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:
 
        $ make install
 
     For the paranoid hackers under us: The above command really installs under
     prefix _only_, i.e. no other stuff from your system is touched. Even if
     you upgrade an existing installation your configuration files in
     PREFIX/etc/ are preserved.

  6. Testing the package
     -------------------
 
     Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately running
 
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
 
     and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
     http://localhost/ (when you built and installed Apache as root or at
     least used the --without-confadjust option) or http://localhost:8080/
     (when you built and installed Apache as a regular user). Then stop the
     server again by running: 

        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop
 
  7. Customizing the package
     -----------------------
 
     Finally you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the
     configuration files under PREFIX/etc/.
 
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/httpd.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/access.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/srm.conf
 
     Have a look at the Apache manual under htdocs/manual/ or
     http://www.apache.org/docs/ for a complete reference of available
     configuration directives.

  8. Preparing the system
     --------------------

     Proper operation of a public HTTP server requires at least the following:

     1. A correctly working TCP/IP layer, since HTTP is implemented on top of
        TCP/IP. Although modern Unix platforms have good networking layers,
        always make sure you have all official vendor patches referring to the
        network layer applied.

     2. Accurate time keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are
        expressed as the time of day.  So, it's time to investigate setting
        some time synchronization facility on your system. Usually the ntpdate
        or xntpd programs are used for this purpose which are based on the
        Network Time Protocol (NTP). See the Usenet newsgroup
        comp.protocols.time.ntp and the NTP homepage at
        http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ for more details about NTP software
        and public time servers.
