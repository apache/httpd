  APACHE INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

  Quick Start - Unix
  ------------------

  For complete installation documentation, see [ht]docs/manual/install.html or
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html

     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start

     NOTES: * Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which 
              Apache should be installed.  A typical installation
              might use "/usr/local/apache2" for PREFIX (without the
              quotes).

            * Consider if you want to use a previously installed APR and
              APR-Util (such as those provided with many OSes) or if you
              need to use the APR and APR-Util from the apr.apache.org
              project. If the latter, download the latest versions and
              unpack them to ./srclib/apr and ./srclib/apr-util (no
              version numbers in the directory names) and use
              ./configure's --with-included-apr option. This is required
              if you don't have the compiler which the system APR was
              built with.  It can also be advantageous if you are a
              developer who will be linking your code with Apache or using
              a debugger to step through server code, as it removes the
              possibility of version or compile-option mismatches with APR
              and APR-Util code. As a convenience, prepackaged source-code
              bundles of APR and APR-Util are occasionally also provided
              as a httpd-2.X.X-deps.tar.gz download.

            * If you are a developer building Apache directly from
              Subversion, you will need to run ./buildconf before running
              configure. This script bootstraps the build environment and
              requires Python as well as GNU autoconf and libtool. If you
              build Apache from a release tarball, you don't have to run
              buildconf.

            * If you want to build a threaded MPM (for instance worker)
              on  FreeBSD, be aware that threads do not work well with
              Apache on FreeBSD versions before 5.4-RELEASE. If you wish
              to try a threaded Apache on an earlier version of FreeBSD,
              use the --enable-threads parameter to ./configure in
              addition to the --with-mpm parameter.

            * If you are building directly from Subversion on Mac OS X
              (Darwin), make sure to use GNU Libtool 1.4.2 or newer. All
              recent versions of the developer tools on this platform
              include a sufficiently recent version of GNU Libtool (named
              glibtool, but buildconf knows where to find it).

  For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a
  typical example which configures Apache for the installation tree
  /sw/pkg/apache with a particular compiler and flags plus the two
  additional modules mod_rewrite and mod_speling for later loading
  through the DSO mechanism:

     $ CC="pgcc" CFLAGS="-O2" \
     ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
     --enable-rewrite=shared \
     --enable-speling=shared 

  The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags for Apache 2.4
  is to run ./configure --help.


  Quick Start - Windows
  ---------------------

  For complete documentation, see manual/platform/windows.html.en or
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/platform/windows.html.

  The Apache/Win32 binaries are distributed as Windows Installer packages 
  (.msi) named httpd-2.4.xx-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi for a version without mod_ssl
  and httpd-2.4.xx-win32-x86-openssl-1.0.1x.msi for a version including the
  mod_ssl plus the openssl library and command line utility.  Additional 64 bit
  binaries have similarly named -win64-x64 package names.  These packages
  may be unpacked without "installing" them by using the msiexec /a option.

  If you have unpacked a source distribution (named httpd-2.4.x-win32-src.zip, 
  without any -x86 or -x64 notation) you must compile the package yourself, 
  see the links mentioned above.  Unless you intended to do this, please look
  again for an .msi package in http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/
  and install that desired .msi package.

  The .msi package configures the httpd.conf file, and installs and starts 
  the Apache2.4 service for you.  It also installs plenty of useful shortcuts
  and the taskbar ApacheMonitor.  We strongly encourage you to use it.
