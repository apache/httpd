  APACHE INSTALLATION

  NOTE: Windows users please read the documents README-WIN.txt and
        http://httpd.apache.org/docs/windows.html, (or the
        htdocs/manual/windows.html file included with Apache). 
        The following applies only to Unix users.

  Introduction
  ============

  Like all good things, there are two ways to configure, compile, and install
  Apache.  You can go for the 3-minute installation process using the APACI
  process described below; or, you can opt for the same mechanism used in
  previous versions of Apache, as described in the file 'src/INSTALL'.  Each
  mechanism has its benefits and drawbacks - APACI is newer and a little more
  raw, but it gets you up and running the least amount of time, whereas the
  "Configuration.tmpl" mechanism may be more familiar and give you some more
  flexibility to the power user.  We'd be very interested in your comments and
  feedback regarding each approach.


  Installing the Apache 1.3 HTTP server with APACI
  ================================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start

     NOTE: PREFIX is not the string "PREFIX". Instead use the Unix
           filesystem path under which Apache should be installed. For
           instance use "/usr/local/apache" for PREFIX above.

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for building Apache:

     o  Disk Space: 

        Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk space
        available.  After installation Apache occupies approximately 3 MB of
        disk space (the actual required disk space depends on the amount of
        compiled in third party modules, etc).

     o  ANSI-C Compiler: 

        Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
        (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version
        2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
        vendors compiler is ANSI compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU
        at http://www.gnu.org/ and the GCC distribution under
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html .

     o  Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:

        For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage' (which are
        written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions 5.003
        and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is found by APACI's
        `configure' script this is no harm.  Of course, you still can build
        and install Apache 1.3. Only those support scripts cannot be used. If
        you have multiple Perl interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from
        the vendor and a Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use
        the --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is
        selected by APACI.

     o  Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:

        To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load modules
        under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the pragmatic
        dlopen()/dlsym() system calls. These system calls are not available
        under all operating systems therefore you cannot use the DSO mechanism
        on all platforms. And Apache currently has only limited built-in
        knowledge on how to compile shared objects because this is heavily
        platform-dependent. The current state is this:

        o Out-of-the-box supported platforms are:
           - Linux     - SunOS         - UnixWare     - Darwin/Mac OS
           - FreeBSD   - Solaris       - AIX          - OpenStep/Mach
           - OpenBSD   - IRIX          - SCO          - DYNIX/ptx
           - NetBSD    - HPUX          - ReliantUNIX
           - BSDI      - Digital Unix  - DGUX

        o Entirely unsupported platforms are:
           - Ultrix

        If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler and
        linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT
        below) manually or at least make sure a Perl 5 interpreter is
        installed from which Apache can guess the options.

        For more in-depth information about DSO support in Apache 1.3 please
        read the document htdocs/manual/dso.html carefully. Especially the
        section entitled "Advantages & Disadvantages" because using the DSO
        mechanism can have strange side-effects if you are not careful. BE
        WARNED!

  3. Configuring the source tree
     ---------------------------

     NOTE: Although we'll often advise you to read the src/Configuration.tmpl
           file parts to better understand the various options in this
           section, there is _AT NO TIME_ any need to _EDIT_ this file. The
           _COMPLETE_ configuration takes place via command line arguments and
           local shell variables for the ./configure script. The
           src/Configuration.tmpl file is just a _READ-ONLY_ resource, here.

     Introduction:

     The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your particular
     platform and personal requirements. The most important setup here is the
     location prefix where Apache is to be installed later, because Apache has
     to be configured for this location to work correctly. But there are a lot
     of other options available for your pleasure.

     For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a typical
     example which compiles Apache for the installation tree /sw/pkg/apache
     with a particular compiler and flags plus the two additional modules
     mod_rewrite and mod_proxy for later loading through the DSO mechanism: 

     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
                   --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
                   --enable-module=proxy   --enable-shared=proxy

     The complete reference of all configuration possibilities follows. For
     more real-life configuration examples please check out the file
     README.configure.

			     [--server-uid=UID]
			     [--server-gid=GID]

     Use the CC, OPTIM, CFLAGS, INCLUDES, LDFLAGS, LIBS, CFLAGS_SHLIB,
     LD_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT, RANLIB, DEPS and TARGET
     environment variables to override the corresponding default entries in
     the src/Configuration.tmpl file (see there for more information about
     their usage).

         Note: The syntax ``KEY=VALUE ./configure ...'' (one single line!) is
               the GNU Autoconf compatible way of specifying defines and can
               be used with Bourne shell compatible shells only (sh, bash,
               ksh). If you use a different type of shell either use ``env
               KEY=VALUE ./configure ...'' when the `env' command is available
               on your system or use ``setenv KEY VALUE; ./configure ...'' if
               you use one of the C-shell variants (csh, tcsh).

         Note: The above parameter names are the canonical ones used in
               Autoconf-style interfaces. But because src/Configuration.tmpl
               uses the prefix EXTRA_ for some variables (e.g. EXTRA_CFLAGS)
               these variants are accepted for backward-compatibility reasons,
               too. But please use the canonical Autoconf-style names and
               don't rely on this.

     Use the --prefix=PREFIX and --exec-prefix=EPREFIX options to configure
     Apache to use a particular installation prefix. The default is
     PREFIX=/usr/local/apache and EPREFIX=PREFIX.

     Use the --bindir=DIR, --sbindir=DIR, --libexecdir=DIR, --mandir=DIR,
     --sysconfdir=DIR, --datadir=DIR, --includedir=DIR, --localstatedir=DIR,
     --runtimedir=DIR, --logfiledir=DIR and proxycachedir=DIR option to change
     the paths for particular subdirectories of the installation tree.
     Defaults are bindir=EPREFIX/bin, sbindir=EPREFIX/sbin,
     libexecdir=EPREFIX/libexec, mandir=PREFIX/man, sysconfdir=PREFIX/etc,
     datadir=PREFIX/share, includedir=PREFIX/include,
     localstatedir=PREFIX/var, runtimedir=PREFIX/var/run,
     logfiledir=PREFIX/var/log and proxycachedir=PREFIX/var/proxy.

         Note: To reduce the pollution of shared installation locations
               (like /usr/local/ or /etc) with Apache files to a minimum the
               string ``/apache'' is automatically appended to 'libexecdir',
               'sysconfdir', 'datadir', 'localstatedir' and 'includedir' if
               (and only if) the following points apply for each path
               individually:

                   1. the path doesn't already contain the word ``apache''
                   2. the path was not directly customized by the user

               Keep in mind that per default these paths are derived from
               'prefix' and 'exec-prefix', so usually its only a matter
               whether these paths contain ``apache'' or not. Although the
               defaults were defined with experience in mind you always should
               make sure the paths fit your situation by checking the finally
               chosen paths via the --layout option.

     Use the --with-layout=[F:]ID option to select a particular installation
     path base-layout. You always _HAVE_ to select a base-layout. There are
     currently two layouts pre-defined in the file config.layout: `Apache' for
     the classical Apache path layout and `GNU' for a path layout conforming
     to the GNU `standards' document. When you want to use your own custom
     layout FOO, either add a corresponding "<Layout FOO>...</Layout>" section
     to config.layout and use --with-layout=FOO or place it into your own
     file, say config.mypaths, and use --with-layout=config.mypaths:FOO.
 
     Use the --show-layout option to check the final installation path layout
     while fiddling with the options above.
 
     Use the --enable-rule=NAME and --disable-rule=NAME options to enable or
     disable a particular Rule from the Apache src/Configuration.tmpl file. The
     defaults (yes=enabled, no=disabled) can either be seen when running
     `./configure --help' or manually looked up in the src/Configuration.tmpl
     file.
 
     Use the --add-module=FILE option to copy a module source file to the
     Apache src/modules/extra/ directory and on-the-fly add an entry for it in
     the configuration file. FILE has to be a valid path to a C source file
     outside the Apache source tree, for instance /path/to/mod_foo.c, or a
     path to an already existing C source code file in src/modules/extra/, such
     as src/modules/extra/mod_foo.c, in which case no copying will be done.
     The added module this is way is automatically activated and enabled. Use
     this option to automatically include a simple third-party module to the
     Apache build process.

     Use the --activate-module=FILE option to add an entry for an existing
     module object or library file into the configuration file on-the-fly.
     FILE has to be a valid path beginning with "src/modules/", and the
     corresponding file has to have been copied to this location in the Apache
     source tree before running configure.  The module is automatically
     enabled. Use this option to automatically include a complex third-party
     module to the Apache build process where, for instance a module like
     mod_perl or mod_php3 consisting of more than one file which are created
     by a third-party configuration scheme.

     Use the --enable-module=NAME and --disable-module=NAME options to enable
     or disable a particular already distributed module from the Apache
     src/Configuration.tmpl file. The correct module names (no `mod_' prefix!)
     and defaults (yes=enabled, no=disabled) can be seen when running
     `./configure --help'.  There are two special NAME variants: `all' for
     enabling or disabling all modules and `most' for enabling or disabling
     only these modules which are useable on all platforms (currently this is
     `all' minus the modules `auth_db', `log_agent', `log_referer', `example',
     `so' and `mmap_static'). For a compact overview of available modules see
     the following list (remove the `mod_' prefix to get the NAME).

                    (+) = enabled  per default [disable with --disable-module]
                    (-) = disabled per default [enable  with --enable-module ]


     Use the --enable-shared=NAME and --disable-shared=NAME options to enable
     or disable the shared object support for a particular module from the
     Apache src/Configuration.tmpl file. The defaults (yes=enabled,
     no=disabled) can be seen when running `./configure --help'. There are two
     special NAME variants: `max' for enabling or disabling DSO on all modules
     except the bootstrapping `so' module and `remain' for enabling or
     disabling DSO for only those modules which are still not enabled (which
     this way implicitly enables them itself). 
     
         Note 1: The --enable-shared option DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY enable the
                 module because there are variants like `--enable-shared=max'
                 which should not imply `--enable-module=all'.  

         Note 2: Per default the DSO mechanism is globally disabled, i.e. no
                 modules are build as shared objects.

         Note 3: The usage of any --enable-shared option automatically implies
                 a --enable-module=so option because the bootstrapping module
                 mod_so is always needed for DSO support.

         Note 4: When you later want to extend your Apache installation via
                 third-party modules through the DSO+APXS mechanism make sure
                 that you at least compile with mod_so included, even when no
                 distributed modules are build as shared objects. This can be
                 achieved by explicitly using --enable-module=so.

         Note 5: Some platforms require --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE for
                 the DSO mechanism to work, i.e. when you want to use
                 --enable-shared for some modules on these platforms you also
                 have to enable the SHARED_CORE rule. For more details please
                 read the document `htdocs/manual/dso.html'.

     Use the --permute-module=N1:N2 option to permutate the AddModule lines of
     modules mod_N1 and mod_N2 in the Configuration file. This way one can
     give modules different priorities.  Two special and important variants
     are supported for the option argument: first BEGIN:N which permutes
     module mod_N with the begin of the module list, i.e. it `moves' the
     module to the begin of the list (gives it lowest priority).  And second
     N:END which permutes mod_N with the end of the module list, i.e. it
     `moves' the module to the end of the list (gives it highest priority).

     Use the --with-perl=FILE option to select a particular Perl interpreter
     executable to be used with Apache. Per default APACI tries to find it
     automatically. But if multiple Perl instances exist on your system you
     have to select the correct one manually.
 
     Use the --without-support option to explicitly disable the build and
     installation of support tools from the src/support/ area. This can be
     useful when you have compilation problems with one or more of these not
     programs on your platform or if you just don't need them.

     Use the --without-confadjust option to explicitly disable some built
     user/situation dependent adjustments to the config files (Group, Port,
     ServerAdmin, ServerName, etc.).  This is usually only interesting for
     vendor package maintainers who wants to force the keeping of defaults.

     Use the --without-execstrip option to disable the stripping of
     executables on installation. This can be important on some platforms in
     combination with --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE or when Apache was built with
     debugging symbols which shouldn't be lost.
 
     Use the --enable-suexec option to enable the suEXEC feature by building
     and installing the "suexec" support program. Use --suexec-caller=UID to
     set the allowed caller user id, --suexec-userdir=DIR to set the user
     subdirectory, --suexec-docroot=DIR to set the suexec root directory,
     --suexec-uidmin=UID/--suexec-gidmin=GID to set the minimal allowed
     UID/GID, --suexec-logfile=FILE to set the logfile and
     --suexec-safepath=PATH to set the safe shell PATH for the suEXEC
     feature. At least one --suexec-xxxxx option has to be provided together
     with the --enable-suexec option to let APACI accept your request for
     using the suEXEC feature.

     CAUTION: FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE SUEXEC FEATURE WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO
              FIRST READ THE DOCUMENT htdocs/manual/suexec.html BEFORE USING
              THE ABOVE OPTIONS.
     
              USING THE SUEXEC FEATURE PROPERLY CAN REDUCE CONSIDERABLY THE
              SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED WITH ALLOWING USERS TO DEVELOP AND RUN
              PRIVATE CGI OR SSI PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, IF SUEXEC IS IMPROPERLY
              CONFIGURED, IT CAN CAUSE ANY NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY
              CREATE NEW HOLES IN YOUR COMPUTER'S SECURITY.  IF YOU AREN'T
              FAMILIAR WITH MANAGING SETUID ROOT PROGRAMS AND THE SECURITY
              ISSUES THEY PRESENT, WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU NOT CONSIDER
              USING SUEXEC AND KEEP AWAY FROM THESE OPTIONS!

     Use the --shadow option to let APACI create a shadow source tree of the
     sources for building. This is useful when you want to build for different
     platforms in parallel (usually through a NFS, AFS or DFS mounted
     filesystem).  You may specify a directory to the --shadow option into
     which the shadow tree will be created.
 
     Use the --quiet option to disable all configuration verbose messages.
 
     Use the --verbose option to enable additional verbose messages.
     
     Use the --server-uid option to specify the user ID you want the server to run
     as. If not specified the server will run as user nobody.  If the user ID
     specified is different than the ID of the user starting the server, you need to
     start the server as root.

     Use the --server-gid option to specify the group ID you want the server user ID to
     be a member of.  If not specified, the group ID will be #-1.

  4. Building the package
     --------------------
     
     Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
     simply running the command
 
        $ make 
 
     Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete
     under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependend on the amount of
     modules you have enabled. 
 
  5. Installing the package
     ----------------------
     
     Now its time to install the package under the configured installation
     PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:
 
        $ make install
 
     For the paranoid hackers under us: The above command really installs under
     prefix _only_, i.e. no other stuff from your system is touched. Even if
     you upgrade an existing installation your configuration files in
     PREFIX/etc/ are preserved.

     Note for package authors:

     To simplify rolling a package tarball from the installed files APACI
     provides a way to override the installation root for the install step.
     Additionally you can get rid of the user message at the end of the
     installation process by using the `install-quiet' target. Example:

         $ make install-quiet root=/tmp/apache-root

     Notes for specific platforms:

     NOTE: Please note that for re-installing Apache on AIX you should use the
           command `slibclean' before using `make install' to really unload
           any old versions of the DSO's that might still be cached by the
           dynamic loader.  

  6. Testing the package
     -------------------
 
     Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately running
 
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
 
     and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
     http://localhost/ (when you built and installed Apache as root or at
     least used the --without-confadjust option) or http://localhost:8080/
     (when you built and installed Apache as a regular user). Then stop the
     server again by running: 

        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop
 
  7. Customizing the package
     -----------------------
 
     Finally you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the
     configuration files under PREFIX/etc/.
 
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/httpd.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/access.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/srm.conf
 
     Have a look at the Apache manual under htdocs/manual/ or
     http://www.apache.org/docs/ for a complete reference of available
     configuration directives.

  8. Preparing the system
     --------------------

     Proper operation of a public HTTP server requires at least the following:

     1. A correctly working TCP/IP layer, since HTTP is implemented on top of
        TCP/IP. Although modern Unix platforms have good networking layers,
        always make sure you have all official vendor patches referring to the
        network layer applied.

     2. Accurate time keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are
        expressed as the time of day.  So, it's time to investigate setting
        some time synchronization facility on your system. Usually the ntpdate
        or xntpd programs are used for this purpose which are based on the
        Network Time Protocol (NTP). See the Usenet newsgroup
        comp.protocols.time.ntp and the NTP homepage at
        http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ for more details about NTP software
        and public time servers.
