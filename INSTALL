  APACHE INSTALLATION

  Introduction
  ============

  Apache 2.0's configuration and installation environment has changed
  completely from Apache 1.3.  Apache 1.3 used a custom set of scripts
  to achieve easy installation.  Apache 2.0 now uses libtool and
  autoconf to create an environment that looks like many other Open
  Source projects.


  Installing the Apache 2.0 HTTP server
  =====================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start

     NOTE: PREFIX is not the string "PREFIX". Instead use the Unix
           filesystem path under which Apache should be installed. For
           instance use "/usr/local/apache" for PREFIX above.

     NOTE: if you are building from a copy of the Apache CVS
           repository, rather than a release distribution, then you
	   must use the "buildconf" script before running configure.

     NOTE: If you are building on FreeBSD, you should add the argument
           --with-mpm=prefork to the configure line.  The Apache Group
           has discovered that threads do not work well with Apache
           on FreeBSD.  For that reason, we disable threads by default
           on FreeBSD, and you need to build the prefork MPM.  If you wish
           to try to make threads work on FreeBSD, they can be re-enabled
           by using --enable-threads

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for building Apache:

     o  Disk Space: 

        Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk
        space available.  After installation Apache occupies
        approximately 5 MB of disk space (the actual required disk
        space depends on the amount of compiled in third party
        modules, etc).

     o  ANSI-C Compiler: 

        Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C
        compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is
        recommended (version 2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC
        then at least make sure your vendors compiler is ANSI
        compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU at
        http://www.gnu.org/ and the GCC distribution under
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html .

     o  Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:

        For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage'
        (which are written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required
        (versions 5.003 and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is
        found by the `configure' script this is no harm.  Of
        course, you still can build and install Apache 2.0. Only those
        support scripts cannot be used. If you have multiple Perl
        interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from the vendor and a
        Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use the
        --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is
        selected by ./configure.

     o  Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:

        To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load
        modules under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the
        pragmatic apr_dso_open()/apr_dso_sym() calls. These calls
        are not available under all operating systems therefore you
        cannot use the DSO mechanism on all platforms. Apache relies
        on autoconf to detect the ability to use DSOs, and libtool to
        determine how to build DSOs. If your platform is supported by
        libtool, and we can find DSO system calls, then DSOs should
        work out-of-the-box. 

        If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler
        and linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and
        LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT below) manually or at least make sure a
        Perl 5 interpreter is installed from which Apache can guess
        the options.


     If you are building from a copy of the CVS repository, rather
     than a release distribution, then you will need these additional
     tools:

     o  Libtool 1.3.3:

        Make sure that you have libtool 1.3.3 or later installed
        before trying to configure and build Apache 2.0.  Libtool can
        be downloaded from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), at
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.

     o  Autoconf 2.13:

        Make sure that you have autoconf 2.13 or later installed
        before trying to configure and build Apache 2.0.  Autoconf can
        be downloaded from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), at
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.


  3. Configuring the source tree
     ---------------------------

     Setup:

     If you have downloading the Apache 2.0 from the CVS, rather than
     a release distribution, then you will need to prepare the source
     tree for configuration and compilation. This is done by running:
 
     ./buildconf

     This script ensures that all required programs are installed on
     the currently machine, and creates the ./configure script.  If
     you are using a package downloaded from apache.org then this step
     is not necessary.

     Introduction:

     The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your
     particular platform and personal requirements. The most important
     setup here is the location prefix where Apache is to be installed
     later, because Apache has to be configured for this location to
     work correctly. But there are a lot of other options available
     for your pleasure.

     For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a
     typical example which compiles Apache for the installation tree
     /sw/pkg/apache with a particular compiler and flags plus the two
     additional modules mod_rewrite and mod_speling for later loading
     through the DSO mechanism:

     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
                   --enable-rewrite=shared \
                   --enable-speling=shared

     The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags for Apache
     2.0 is to run ./configure --help.  What follows is a brief
     description of most of the arguments.

     Reference:

     $ [CC=...]        [CFLAGS_SHLIB=...]           [TARGET=...]

                             [--datadir=DIR]           
                             [--includedir=DIR]        
                             [--localstatedir=DIR]

                             [--logfiledir=DIR]        [--suexec-caller=UID]
                             [--proxycachedir=DIR]     [--suexec-docroot=DIR]
                             [--with-layout=[FILE:]ID] [--suexec-logfile=FILE]
                                                       [--suexec-userdir=DIR]
                             [--with-perl=FILE]        [--suexec-uidmin=UID]
                             [--without-support]       [--suexec-gidmin=GID]
                             [--without-confadjust]    [--suexec-safepath=PATH]
                             [--without-execstrip]
			     [--server-uid=UID]        [--with-maintainter-mode]
			     [--server-gid=GID]

     Use the CC, OPTIM, CFLAGS, INCLUDES, LDFLAGS, LIBS, CFLAGS_SHLIB,
     LD_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT, RANLIB, DEPS and
     TARGET environment variables to override and expand the corresponding
     default entries as determined by configure. Use NOTEST_CFLAGS
     and NOTEST_LDFLAGS to add entries that should be used only during
     the actual build and compilation of Apache, such as -Werror.

     Use the --prefix=PREFIX and --exec-prefix=EPREFIX options to
     configure Apache to use a particular installation prefix. The
     default is PREFIX=/usr/local/apache and EPREFIX=PREFIX.

     Use the --bindir=DIR, --sbindir=DIR, --libexecdir=DIR,
     --mandir=DIR, --sysconfdir=DIR, --datadir=DIR, --iconsdir=DIR,
     --htdocsdir=DIR, --cgidir=DIR, --includedir=DIR,
     --localstatedir=DIR, --runtimedir=DIR, --logfiledir=DIR and
     --proxycachedir=DIR option to change the paths for particular
     subdirectories of the installation tree.  Defaults are
     bindir=EPREFIX/bin, sbindir=EPREFIX/bin,
     libexecdir=EPREFIX/modules, mandir=PREFIX/man,
     sysconfdir=PREFIX/conf, datadir=PREFIX, iconsdir=PREFIX/icons,
     htdocsdir=PREFIX/htdocs, cgidir=PREFIX/cgi-bin,
     includedir=PREFIX/include, localstatedir=PREFIX,
     runtimedir=PREFIX/logs, logfiledir=PREFIX/logs and
     proxycachedir=PREFIX/proxy.

         Note: To reduce the pollution of shared installation
               locations (like /usr/local/ or /etc) with Apache files
               to a minimum the string ``/apache'' is automatically
               appended to 'libexecdir', 'sysconfdir', 'datadir',
               'localstatedir' and 'includedir' if (and only if) the
               following points apply for each path individually:

                   1. the path doesn't already contain the word ``apache''
                   2. the path was not directly customized by the user

               Keep in mind that per default these paths are derived
               from 'prefix' and 'exec-prefix', so usually its only a
               matter whether these paths contain ``apache'' or
               not. Although the defaults were defined with experience
               in mind you always should make sure the paths fit your
               situation by checking the finally chosen paths via the
               --layout option.

     Use the --with-layout=[F:]ID option to select a particular
     installation path base-layout. You always _HAVE_ to select a
     base-layout. There are currently two layouts pre-defined in the
     file config.layout: `Apache' for the classical Apache path layout
     and `GNU' for a path layout conforming to the GNU `standards'
     document. When you want to use your own custom layout FOO, either
     add a corresponding "<Layout FOO>...</Layout>" section to
     config.layout and use --with-layout=FOO or place it into your own
     file, say config.mypaths, and use
     --with-layout=config.mypaths:FOO.
 
     Use the --show-layout option to check the final installation path
     layout while fiddling with the options above.
 
     Use the --enable-NAME=(shared) and --disable-NAME options to
     enable or disable a particular already distributed module from
     the Apache package.

     Use the --with-mpm=NAME option to determine which MPM should be
     built for your server.

     Use the --enable-suexec option to enable the suEXEC feature by
     building and installing the "suexec" support program.

     CAUTION: FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE SUEXEC FEATURE WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND
              YOU TO FIRST READ THE DOCUMENT htdocs/manual/suexec.html
              BEFORE USING THE ABOVE OPTIONS.
     
              USING THE SUEXEC FEATURE PROPERLY CAN REDUCE
              CONSIDERABLY THE SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED WITH ALLOWING
              USERS TO DEVELOP AND RUN PRIVATE CGI OR SSI
              PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, IF SUEXEC IS IMPROPERLY CONFIGURED,
              IT CAN CAUSE ANY NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY CREATE
              NEW HOLES IN YOUR COMPUTER'S SECURITY.  IF YOU AREN'T
              FAMILIAR WITH MANAGING SETUID ROOT PROGRAMS AND THE
              SECURITY ISSUES THEY PRESENT, WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT
              YOU NOT CONSIDER USING SUEXEC AND KEEP AWAY FROM THESE
              OPTIONS!

     Use the --quiet option to disable all configuration verbose
     messages.
 

  4. Building the package
     --------------------
     
     Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package
     by simply running the command:
 
        $ make 
 
     Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to
     complete under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependend on the
     amount of modules you have enabled.

 
  5. Installing the package
     ----------------------
     
     Now its time to install the package under the configured
     installation PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:
 
        $ make install
 
     For the paranoid hackers under us: The above command really
     installs under prefix _only_, i.e. no other stuff from your
     system is touched. Even if you upgrade an existing installation
     your configuration files in PREFIX/conf/ are preserved.


  6. Testing the package
     -------------------
 
     Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately
     running:
 
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
 
     and then you should be able to request your first document via
     URL http://localhost/ (when you built and installed Apache as
     root or at least used the --without-confadjust option) or
     http://localhost:8080/ (when you built and installed Apache as a
     regular user). Then stop the server again by running:

        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop

 
  7. Customizing the package
     -----------------------
 
     Finally you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the
     configuration files under PREFIX/conf/.
 
        $ vi PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf
 
     Have a look at the Apache manual under docs/manual/ or
     http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ for a complete reference of
     available configuration directives.


  8. Preparing the system
     --------------------

     Proper operation of a public HTTP server requires at least the
     following:

     1. A correctly working TCP/IP layer, since HTTP is implemented on
        top of TCP/IP. Although modern Unix platforms have good
        networking layers, always make sure you have all official
        vendor patches referring to the network layer applied.

     2. Accurate time keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are
        expressed as the time of day.  So, it's time to investigate
        setting some time synchronization facility on your
        system. Usually the ntpdate or xntpd programs are used for
        this purpose which are based on the Network Time Protocol
        (NTP). See the Usenet newsgroup comp.protocols.time.ntp and
        the NTP homepage at http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ for more
        details about NTP software and public time servers.
