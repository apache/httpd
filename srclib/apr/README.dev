Apache Portable Runtime
=======================

If you are building APR from SVN, you need to use a slightly non-standard
build process.  You must have autoconf and libtool installed for this to
work.  There are three steps:

1) ./buildconf
2) ./configure
3) make

If you are building APR from a distribution tarball, buildconf will have
already been run for you, and you therefore do not need to have either
autoconf or libtool installed, and you do not need to run buildconf.  Skip
step one above and just run configure then make.

Generating Test Coverage information
====================================

If you want to generate test coverage data, use the following steps:

1) ./buildconf
2) CFLAGS="-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" ./configure
3) make
4) cd test
5) make
6) ./testall
7) cd ..
8) make gcov
