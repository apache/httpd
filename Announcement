                   Apache HTTP Server 1.3.29 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.29 of the Apache HTTP
   Server ("Apache").  This Announcement notes the significant changes
   in 1.3.29 as compared to 1.3.28.

   This version of Apache is principally a bug fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.

   We consider Apache 1.3.29 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.29 is available for download from
   
       http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
                - or -
       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

       http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available. Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While  the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

                     Apache 1.3.29 Major changes


  New features

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Enabled RFC1413 ident functionality for both Win32 and
       NetWare platforms.  This also included an alternate thread safe
       implementation of the socket timout functionality when querying
       the identd daemon.

  Bugs fixed

   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.28 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.29:

     * Within ap_bclose(), ap_pclosesocket() is now called consistently
       for sockets and ap_pclosef() for files. Also, closesocket()
       is used consistenly to close socket fd's. The previous
       confusion between socket and file fd's would cause problems
       with some applications now that we proactively close fd's to
       prevent leakage. PR 22805
 
     * Fixed mod_usertrack to not get false positive matches on the
       user-tracking cookie's name.  PR 16661.

     * Prevent creation of subprocess Zombies when using CGI wrappers
       such as suExec and cgiwrap. PR 21737. [Numerous]
