                   Apache HTTP Server 1.3.35 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.34 of the Apache HTTP
   Server ("Apache").  This Announcement notes the significant changes
   in 1.3.35 as compared to 1.3.34.

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.35 addresses and fixes 1 potential
   security issue:

     o CVE-2005-3352 (cve.mitre.org)
       mod_imap: Escape untrusted referer header before outputting in HTML
       to avoid potential cross-site scripting.  Change also made to
       ap_escape_html so we escape quotes.  Reported by JPCERT

   We consider Apache 1.3.35 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.34 is available for download from:

   Please consult the CHANGES_1.3 file for a full list of changes.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.  Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPF threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0/2.2 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on Unix and non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0/2.2 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms. We consider Apache 2.0.57 and 2.2.2 to be the best available
   versions at the time of this release.  We offer Apache 1.3.35 as the best
   legacy  version of Apache 1.3 available, and strongly recommend that users
   who require compatibility with existing Apache 1.3 installations should
   upgrade as soon as possible.  Users should first consider upgrading to
   the current release of Apache 2 instead.
