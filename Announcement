Apache 2.0beta1 Released
-------------------------

After two long years of development he Apache Group is pleased to announce 
the release of the first public beta release of Apache 2.0.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase. The most visible and noteworthy addition
is the ability to run Apache in a hybrid thread/process mode on any
platform that supports both threads and processes.  This has shown to
improve the scalability of the Apache HTTPD server significantly in
our early testing, on some versions of Unix.  With this version of Apache,
we have also added support for filtered I/O.  This allows modules to modify
the output of other modules before it is sent to the client.  This release also
greatly improves the performance and robustness of Apache on the
Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.  This beta includes support for IPv6
on all platforms that support IPv6.

This version of Apache is known to work on many versions of Unix, BeOS,
OS/2, and Windows.  Because of many of the advancements in Apache 2.0,
Apache performs equally on all supported platforms.

There are new snapshots of the Apache httpd source available every 6
hours from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/apache-2.0/ - please
download and test if you feel brave. We don't guarantee anything
except that it will take up disk space, but if you have the time and
skills, please give it a spin on your platforms.

Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April of 1996. The May 2000 WWW server site survey by Netcraft (see:
http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/) found that more web servers were
using Apache than any other software running on more than 60% of the
Internet web servers.

Changes with Apache 2.0b1

  *) Apache is now IPv6-capable.  On systems where APR supports IPv6,
     Apache gets IPv6 listening sockets by default.  Additionally, the
     Listen, NameVirtualHost, and <VirtualHost> directives support IPv6
     numeric address strings (e.g., "Listen [fe80::1]:8080").
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Modify the install directory layout.  Modules are now installed in
     modules/.  Shared libraries should be installed in libraries/, but
     we don't have any of those on Unix yet.  All install directories
     are modifyable at configure time. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Install all header files in the same directory on Unix. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the functions in server/linked into the server, regardless of
     which modules linked into the server.  This uses the same hack
     for Apache that we use for APR and apr-util to ensure all of the
     necessary functions are linked.  As a part of thise, the CHARSET_EBCDIC
     was renamed to AP_CHARSET_EBCDIC for namespace protection, and to make
     the scripts a bit easier.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rework the RFC1413 handling to make it thread-safe, use a timeout
     on the query, and remove IPv4 dependencies.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get all of the auth modules to the point that they will install and
     be loadable into the server.  Our new build/install mechanism expects
     that all modules will have a common name format.  The auth modules
     didn't use that format, so we didn't install them properly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) API routines ap_pgethostbyname() and ap_pduphostent() are no longer
     available.  Use apr_getaddrinfo() instead.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get "NameVirtualHost *" working in 2.0.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Return HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE if the every range requested starts
     after the end of the response. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get byterange requests working with responses that do not have a
     content-length.  Because of the way byterange requests work, we have to
     have all of the data before we can actually do the byterange, so we
     can compute the content-length in the byterange filter.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get exe CGI's working again on Windows.
     [Allan Edwards]

  *) Get mod_cgid and mod_rewrite to work as DSOs by changing the way
     they keep track of whether or not their  post config hook has been
     called before.  Instead of a static variable (which is replaced when
     the DSO is loaded a second time), use userdata in the process pool.
     [Jeff Trawick]
