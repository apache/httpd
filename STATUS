CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.  Note 2.2.18 contained an incompatible ABI change,
    subsequently corrected, and should not be referenced.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

  * core: Limit ap_pregsub() to 64MB, add ap_pregsub_ex() for longer strings.
    The default limit can be adjusted at compile time using AP_PREGSUB_MAXLEN.
    mod_setenvif: Log error on substitution overflow.

    IMPORTANT: This could break existing configurations which rely on 
               substitutions > 64MB.  Those sites need to rebuild with an
               override of AP_PREGSUB_MAXLEN.
               2.4.x has a much smaller limit on ap_pregsub() because that change
               was introduced with the new release.

    trunk patch:
       util.c: too many to list, as it is tied up in other added features and follow-
               up fixes; I started with 2.4.x HEAD and backed out some semantic changes

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * mod_cache: Realign the cache_quick_handler() to behave identically
    to the default_handler() when reacting to errors when writing to the
    filter stack. Stops APR errors appearing in access_log as result codes.
    Trunk patches: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1003913

    +1: minfrin
    trawick: any reason it shouldn't be completely aligned with default_handler's
             choice to return OK vs. 500?
    rpluem: Agreed with trawick. They should behave the same.

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.2.x patch:
       http://www.links.org/files/npn-patch-2.2.patch
     +1: benl
     sf notes: needs the buffer overflow fix from r1345599, too
     wrowe notes: also needs correction to
       ssl_engine_kernel.c: In function 'ssl_callback_AdvertiseNextProtos':
       ssl_engine_kernel.c:2140:5: warning: implicit declaration of function
                                   'modssl_run_npn_advertise_protos_hook'
                  Including mod_ssl.h after ssl_private.h seems to suffice.
                  The change introduces hard linkages from modules into
                  mod_ssl.so (distinct from httpd), AP is the incorrect
                  namespace, see mod_dav main hooks as an example.
                  Prior to this patch all calls to mod_ssl were by way of
                  registered functions through apr bindings.  Seems there
                  aught to be a way to add an npn cooperating module when
                  mod_ssl is not loaded, but right now it would fail.
                  An mmn minor bump would also be required for API addition.

     -1: rjung
     rjung: the proposed 2.2 patch also changes LDAPTrustedClientCert to OR_AUTHCFG.
            This change seems to come from PR46541 which needs a bigger backport (r915660)
            Note: covener commented it in the PR as "I don't think LDAPTrustedClientCert can
            really be made usable in 2.2.".
     rjung: I don't understand what was voted on, the backport of both revisions
            or only the PR attachment. The latter is only about r627637.
     covener: withdrawing my vote, I reviewed the attachment but missed the OR_AUTHCFG change.

    +1: minfrin, jim, poirier
    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported
               syntax errors to further confuse the administrator.]

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

 * mod_disk_cache: Decline the opportunity to cache if the response is

    them, as in the following proposal?
    rpluem says: As poirier correctly mentions, the same must be done for mod_mem_cache
    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
     Cache-Control header, and arbitrarily denied if both headers were missing.

    druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
    kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
            RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental".
            The API in the OpenSSL implementation from May 2012
            (http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22601) only covers the
            privately-defined TLSEXT_AUTHZDATAFORMAT_audit_proof, there's
            no support for x509_attr_cert (section 3.3.1 in RFC 5878) or
            saml_assertion (3.3.2). SSL_CTX_use_authz_file doesn't have
            any docs in OpenSSL, either, and there's no "openssl foo ..."
            command or similar to create/manage such files.
            Note: as of 2013-04-15, r1352596 has been reverted in trunk,
            (with r1468131), for the reasons explained in the message with id
            <515FED7C.5010009@velox.ch> sent to the dev list on 2013-04-06.
    ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
         any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
         why it is not premature.
