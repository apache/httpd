CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.  Note 2.2.18 contained an incompatible ABI change,
    subsequently corrected, and should not be referenced.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:



PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

  * mod_filter: FilterProvider conditions of type "resp=" (response headers)
    do not work for CGI, because headers_out are not populated. We need to use
    err_headers_out instead in this case. In trunk this is handled by ap_expr().
    Joe recently added fall back to err_headers_out to ap_expr and the proposed
    mod_filter patch is analogous to Joe's fix.
    The patch fixes the test suite failure for t/modules/filter.t.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * mod_cache: Realign the cache_quick_handler() to behave identically
    to the default_handler() when reacting to errors when writing to the
    filter stack. Stops APR errors appearing in access_log as result codes.

    +1: sf
    +0: covener did you see Jim's initial concern on introducing the 
        ap_construct_url() in maintenance?  This dissuaded me from 
        proposing the same.
    sf replies: I think that was mainly refering to the fact that in the 
                !ap_is_url(ret) case, the trunk version returns internal
                server error while the 2.2 version just does nothing.
                In that case, there is a log message with level error, but
                that is not the one I want to change.

    header

  * mod_win32: Invert logic for env var UTF-8 fixing.
    Now we exclude a list of vars which we know for sure they
    dont hold UTF-8 chars; all other vars will be fixed. This
    has the benefit that now also all vars from 3rd-party modules
    will be fixed. This fix is based on PR 13029 / 34985, and 
    includes now the SSL_ and GEOIP_ vars; otherwise its impossible
    to run CGIs when mod_ssl and/or mod_geoip are loaded and those 
    mods return UTF-8 chars in any var during a request.

  * mod_ssl: Add SSLProxyMachineCertificateChainFile directive
    Adds a new function in ssl_util_ssl.c SSL_X509_INFO_create_chain that will
    construct a chain of trusted certificates. When a remote server requests
    a client certificate that is NOT the direct issuer of any available client
    certificate, the chain for that certificate will be used to trace it to a
    known CA and that client certificate will be used.

    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported
               syntax errors to further confuse the administrator.]

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).

    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
