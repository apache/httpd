DAEDALUS 2.0 PROBLEMS:

    * seg fault involving dir_cleanup() on invalid directories
      core dumps: /usr/local/apache2/corefiles/httpd.core.[12358]
        Status: Bill S probably fixed this with rev. 1.54 of
                /apr/file_io/unix/dir.c, need to verify
    
    * assert pops in ap_setup_client_block(). ap_getline() is
      apparently failing to completely empty req_cfg->bb in some cases.
      core dumps: /usr/local/apache2/corefiles/httpd.core.[49]
      see message: <NEBBKBPPOLLGMBILHACFCEHGCBAA.cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>
        Status: Cliff did some analysis of this

    * seg fault involving null server_addr_rec pointer in check_hostalias()
      core dump: /usr/local/apache2/corefiles/httpd.core.7
      see message: <NEBBKBPPOLLGMBILHACFOEHJCBAA.cliffwoolley@yahoo.com>
        Status: Not yet analyzed

    * access log entries are sometimes split (multiple lines)
      seems to be related to FrontPage and/or DAV
        Status: Jeff suspects password hiding code in log_request_line()

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    WARNING: ALWAYS check srclib/apr/STATUS and srclib/apr-util/STATUS

    * Generic Hooks are absolutely wrong in linkage, they are declared as
      exported from APU, but actually exported from modules.  This needs
      heavy fixup, which Bill will do on the plane tommorow.  The actual
      'Apache' declaration is in Apache's files, with the 'explicit linkage'
      flavor in apr-util.  (Unless you folks will finally buckle and accept
      the linkspec in hook declarations.  I'm not holding my breath.)

    * Root all file systems with <Directory /> for WIN32/OS2/NW permissions 
        Status: patch brought forward from 1.3.14
                WIN32 and OS2 need review [William Rowe, Brian Harvard]

    * Win32: Enable the Windows MPM to honor max_requests_per_child
        Status: FirstBill will fix this?

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
	(at least) needs to be done:
	- winnt MPM: Fix 95/98 code paths in the winnt MPM. There is some NT
	specific code that is still not in NT only code paths
	- IOL binds to APR sendfile, implemented with TransmitFile, which 
        is not available on 95/98.
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)

    * Win32: Test access logging with multiple threads. Will the 
	native file I/O calls serialize automagically like the 
	CRT calls or do we need to add region locking each time 
	we access the logs?
	Status: 

    * Win32: Complete the revamp the service environment and relocation
        into the WinNT MPM.  Changes ServerRoot service registry 
        parameter into ConfigArgs for multiple service startup parameters.
        Problems to fix in the revamp: -k shutdown/restart are broken, 
        signals are not being acknowledged.  Close window and shutdown 
        also seem out of sorts.
        OtherBill is working on this and will finish over the weekend.

    * We need a thread-safe resolver, at least on Unix.
        Status: The best known candidate would be something from
	BIND v9.
        Status: Greg asks, "why? doesn't gethostbyname_r() handle this?"

    * The AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter directives do not allow the
      administrator to remove or reorder filters.  Once a filter is added
      in a container, it is present in any subcontainers.  It can only be
      added to the filter chain after any filters specified in enclosing
      containers.

    * remove the --disable-shared from the subdir config of APR(UTIL)
      before the final release. (in fact, it might even be nice to
      allow for Apache config/build against an already-installed
      APR(UTIL))
      Note: we need to do a "make install" for APR(UTIL) so the shared
            libraries can be installed properly. We could also use that
            point to install include files (rather than have Apache
	    know everything that needs to be installed from the
	    sub-packages). The original impetus for doing the
	    disable-shared was because the shared lib wasn't getting
	    installed and a "make clean" in aprutil would make Apache
	    fail to load.

    * users who want to install third-party modules into the Apache
      source tree (for static linking) need to have autoconf and
      libtool installed. This is because the module needs to have its
      config.m4 incorporated into ./configure, which means "buildconf"
      must be run.
      Note: This is in part because we have removed the "extra" directory.
            In the Apache-2.0 repository, this directory had a config.m4
            file that allowed people to add external modules by
            specifying --with-module on the configure line.

    * ap_vrprintf() needs to handle more than 4K
        Status: Greg volunteers

    * mod_dir should normally redirect ALL directory requests which do
      not include a trailing slash on the URI. However, if a "notes"
      flag is set (say, via BrowserMatch), this behavior will be
      disabled for non-GET requests.
        Status: Greg volunteers
        MsgId: <20010227104646.E2297@lyra.org>
        MsgId: <3A9C0097.9C83F07C@Golux.Com>

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * mod_include doesn't stream data when there are no SSI tags in
      a file.  If the OS doesn't have MMAP, this means that the entire
      file is read into memory before we send it down the filter
      stack.  The includes_filter should only ever parse about 9K of
      data at one time, so that we always look like we are streaming
      the data.

    * All of our MPMs should use APR for threads/processes.  This 
      will allow us to error out if a threaded MPM is chosen on a
      platform that doesn't support threads.

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * Document mod_file_cache.

    * OS/2: Get loadable modules working again. Requires shared core support
      which doesn't appear to be catered for in the current build system.

    * OS/2: Make mod_status work for spmt_os2 MPM.

    * Win32: Enable the winnt MPM to use the new scoreboard API

    * Win32: Win9x console window still won't play nice with the
        close window, logoff and shutdown scenarios.
        Status: OtherBill will move the patch forward from 1.3.15, once we 
        get our other Win9x issues solved.

    * Win32: Add a simple hold console open patch (wait for close or
        the ESC key, with a nice message) if the server died a bad 
        death (non-zero exit code) in console mode.
        Status: OtherBill is bringing forward same ugly hack from 1.3.13

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Architect start-up code that avoids initializing all the modules 
      in the parent process on platforms that do not support fork.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Win32: Implement reliable piped logs on Windows

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
        the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
        for predictable mod_auth_db/dbm administration.

    * use apu_dbm in mod_auth_dbm
        Status: Greg +1 (low-priority volunteer)

    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
	- case_preserved_filename stuff
	    (use the new canonical name stuff?)
	- find a new home for ap_text(_header)
	- is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * the LTFLAGS = -export-dynamic in the config.m4 is wrong. it is getting
      added multiple times during the config process. The -export-dynamic
      should probably move into build/special.mk (the make file used for
      building Apache modules).

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * APR-ize resolver stuff in mod_unique_id (Jeff volunteers)

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

    * orig_ct in the byterange/multipart handling may not be
      needed. Apache 1.3 just never stashed "multipart" into
      r->content_type. We should probably follow suit since the
      byterange stuff doesn't want the rest of the code to see the
      multipart content-type; the other code should still think it is
      dealing with the <orig_ct> stuff.
        Status: Greg volunteers to investigate (esp. since he was most 
                likely the one to break it :-)

Other features that need writing:

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: post 2.0

    * TODO in source -- just do an egrep on "TODO" and see what's there

Documentation that needs writing:
    * Mod_status docs are needed.

    * The concept of MPMs, especially if we ship more than one MPM for a
      given platform

    * New directives in the various MPMs and appropriate links from
	obsolete directives in core.html to the MPM documentation.

    * Revise manual/stopping.html and the last part of
	manual/misc/perf-tuning.html to take account of the MPMs.

    * API documentation
        Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
        (apache-2.0/htdocs/hooks.html)

    * Changes since 1.3.9 can be more easily seen in the commitlog file
         dev.apache.org:/home/cvs/CVSROOT/commitlogs/apache-2.0
      which includes some of Roy's comments when the changes were
      committed in rough change-sets by purpose.  Note that the commitlog
      does not show the contents of new files until later.

Available Patches:

   * Jon Travis's <jtravis@covalent.net> patch to deal with thread-safe
     issues with inet_ntoa.  See message <20001201163220.A12827@covalent.net>
	Status:  This is being set aside until the IPv6 work is finished
		 so that we know exactly what is required.

   * Martin Sojka <msojka@gmx.de>'s patch to add error reporting for failed 
     htpasswd actions due to a full /tmp volume (other programs may have
     similar problems?)
        PR: 6475
        Status:

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve
     performance
       Status: These were written for 1.3, and are awaiting a port to
       2.0
 
   * Jim Winstead's <jimw@trainedmonkey.com> patch to add CookieDomain and 
     other small mod_usertrack features

   * Dan Rench's <drench@xnet.com> patch to add allow the errmsg and timefmt 
     of SSI's to be modified in the config file.  Patch is available in 
     PR6193

Open issues:

   * What do we do about mod_proxy?

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?
