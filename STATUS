CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

  * Current exceptions for RTC for this branch:
    . mod_lua
    . documentation
    . non-Unix build
    . non-Unix, single-platform code

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * mod_socache_shmcb.c: Remove arbitrary restriction on shared memory size
    previously limited to 64MB.
    trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/r1493921
                 http://svn.apache.org/r1493925
    2.4.x patch: trunk patch works modulo CHANGES
    +1: minfrin, jim
    sf notes: I think a number of variables need to be changed from int to
              apr_size_t, including subcache_size, subcache_data_offset,
              subcache_data_size, total, cache_total. 
              AIUI, especially cache_total starts to go wrong if the cache
              gets larger than 4GB (UINT_MAX). Maybe set the limit at
              MIN(APR_SIZE_MAX,UINT_MAX) until this is fixed?
    minfrin: Surely we should just fix these unsigned ints? Not sure what value
             there would be in trying to bake in an arbitrary limit in the mean
             time when we can just fix the underlying problem instead.
        jim: Agree w/ minfrin
    sf:      This would require someone to do the work. Until someone has the 
             necessary free cycles, I propose to include
             http://svn.apache.org/r1515162

  * ab: Check if malloc succeeded
    PR54344
    trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1488492
    2.4.x: trunk patch works
    +1: jailletc36, jim
    trawick: what happens if malloc() fails?  same msg error over and over?
             (doubtful it gets better for more than a very short while, until
             the leak or fragmentation overtakes temporary freeing of memory)
             is the state of that connection messed up from leaving
             ssl_proceed_handshake() early?
    sf: I also think that aborting on oom with a clean error message would
        be better.
        I would add http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1542533

  * mod_auth_form: Make sure the optional functions are loaded even when
    the AuthFormProvider isn't specified.
    trunk patch: https://svn.apache.org/r1531672
    2.4.x patch: trunk patch works, modulo CHANGES
    +1: minfrin, jim
    -0 covener: does that mean just loading mod_auth_form w/o mod_request 
                and mod_filter now causes a post-config failure?
    minfrin: It does, however it would only affect configs where mod_auth_form
             has been loaded but not used, as any attempt to use mod_auth_form
             without mod_request and mod_session present would cause the very
             same failure. Would a warning in the release notes be good enough?

  * mod_proxy: support Unix domain sockets
    trunk patch: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1451633

    2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~jim/patches/uds-2.4.patch
    +1: jim
    +/-0: druggeri: I think we should hold until we can work out the performance difference
                    between old and new versions of the patches.

  * mod_proxy: Use consistent canon formats for http, ajp and fcgi (if provided
    port is the default port, don't add to canon URI).
    trunk patch: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1542562

    2.4.x patch: trunk patch works modulo CHANGES

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.

    2.4 patch: http://people.apache.org/~fuankg/diffs/httpd-2.4.x-cross_compile.diff
    fuankg: on hold until we agree for a better and more simple solution ...

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.4.x patch:
       Trunk patch works.
     +1: ben
     sf says: Needs r1345599, too.
              And wrowe's comment about the 2.2 patch is also valid for 2.4:
              http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1354823

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechansisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352596
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ben/httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch
     +1: ben, druggeri
     -1: kbrand
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental".
             The API in the OpenSSL implementation from May 2012
             (http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22601) only covers the
             privately-defined TLSEXT_AUTHZDATAFORMAT_audit_proof, there's
             no support for x509_attr_cert (section 3.3.1 in RFC 5878) or
             saml_assertion (3.3.2). SSL_CTX_use_authz_file doesn't have
             any docs in OpenSSL, either, and there's no "openssl foo ..."
             command or similar to create/manage such files.
             Additionally, httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch includes a build-system
             change which is unrelated to this feature.
             Note: as of 2013-04-15, r1352596 has been reverted in trunk
             (with r1468131), for the reasons explained in the message with id
             <515FED7C.5010009@velox.ch> sent to the dev list on 2013-04-06.
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.
     minfrin: once this gets docs, +1.

   * Makefile.win: Added copying of .vbs / .wsf CGIs to Windows install target.
                   Moved fixing of shebang to separate target so that it is
                   no longer executed by default and all CGIs remain inactive.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1387984

     +1 fuankg, gsmith
     -.8: trawick
          This commit is essentially deciding that an httpd install on
          Windows now has printenv/testcgi written in 2 more languages.
          To the extent that the usefulness is that it shows how to make scripts
          of these types executable by httpd, I believe that the documentation
          is the proper place to solve that.  To the extent that the usefullness
          is to show how to implement a CGI in these particular languages, I believe
          that the httpd distribution and documentation in general is not the
          place for that.  Historically these types of scripts have caused problems
          for downstream vendorsas well as newbies (and sometimes the intersection
          of those two groups) who don't understand that these are information leaks
          once they are enabled, and the subtlety of the way they are disabled ("Apache
          messed up the first line; let me fix that") contributes to that.
     fuankg notes: I've just added a big warning to all CGI scripts which should now
          make absolutely clear that these CGIs are for testing purpose only - so those
          who enable those scripts with inserting the right shebang should be 100% aware
          of any risks (this should cover your last point).
     jim: trawick, does the above address your concerns?
     trawick: to some extent (somebody reading the script gets an idea)
          Why isn't the configuration requirement documented instead
          of described indirectly in a sample?
          Why are these new samples added to the install without three
          votes?  (I didn't veto it; put your name next to the two
          existing ones and I'll be satisified that enough people
          considered this addition as an appropriate solution for a
          real httpd usability problem.)
     wrowe: I'd agree with trawick, and suggest that these scripts can begin
            their life somewhere in the manual/ tree.  This really seems like
            the place where /usr/share/httpd/examples/ would be useful, but
            there isn't an ordinary directory for that.  Since we want none
            of the scripts to function 'out of the box', what about a new
            cgi-examples/ dir alongside cgi-bin/? Otherwise manual/cgi/examples
            might work?
