CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * apr_poll() grows the pool (e.g., pchild or the thread's pool) on
      each call...  Apache MPMs don't have logic to work around this
      issue.

    * On AIX and Tru64, Apache won't load due to an unresolved
      reference to iconv.

CURRENT VOTES:

    * apachectl should revert to just being an init script and
      httpd.sh should be the wrapper for httpd which sources envvars
      and allows any options to be passed through

      +1:  trawick

    * Should we always build [support*] binaries statically unless otherwise
      indicated?
        Message-ID: <20020129210006.B23512@Lithium.MeepZor.Com>

      +1:  Ken, *wrowe [they are PITAs on OSX]
      -1:  Justin, Ian
        
    * If the parent process dies, should the remaining child processes
      "gracefully" self-terminate. Or maybe we should make it a runtime
      option, or have a concept of 2 parent processes (one being a 
      "hot spare").
      See: Message-ID: <3C58232C.FE91F19F@Golux.Com>

      Self-destruct: Ken, Martin
      Not self-destruct: BrianP, Ian, Cliff, BillS
      Make it runtime configurable: Aaron, Jim, Justin
      Have 2 parents: +1: Jim
                      -1: Justin, wrowe [for 2.0]
                      +0: Martin (while standing by, could it do
                                  something useful?)

    * Make the worker MPM the default MPM for threaded Unix boxes.
      +1:   Justin, Ian, Cliff, BillS
      +0:   BrianP, Aaron (mutex contention is looking better with the
            latest code, let's continue tuning and testing)
      -0:   Lars

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * All handlers should always send content down even if r->header_only
      is set.  If not, it means that the HEAD requests don't generate the
      same headers as a GET which is wrong.
      Is this a showstopper?
        +1: Justin
        -1: Aaron

    * server pushed CGI's not working.  (Is this a showstopper??)
      PR: 8482
      Message-ID: <3CE15B85.2FF45121@apache.org>

    * HP/UX 10.20: compile breakage in APR.  Looks like it should be easy
      to fix, probably just some extraneous #include's that are fouling
      things up.
      PR: 9457
      Jeff: See my reply and patch in the PR (and previous commit to
      stop using "pipe" as a field name).  If patch is committed, we
      should be okay.  I'll wait to see if the user tests the patch.
      Update by Jeff 20020722: I got an account on HP 10.20.  It looks
      like some of the APR thread detection is screwed up.  If we find
      pthread.h but we can't compile the pthread test program we still
      think we can use threads.  For that reason, the patch I posted
      to the PR won't work as-is since a failed compile of the test
      program means nothing.

    * exec cmd and suexec arg-passing enhancements
      Status: Patches proposed
      Message-ID: <20020526041748.A29148@prodigy.Redbrick.DCU.IE>
      (see the "proc.patch" and "suexec-shell.patch" links in this message)

    * Get mod_cache/mod_mem_cache out of experimental (still some
      work items left to complete)

    * The 2.0.36 worker MPM graceless shutdown changes work but are
      a bit clunky on some platforms; eg, on Linux, the loop to
      join each worker thread seems to hang, and the parent ends up
      killing off the child with SIGKILL.  But at least it shuts down.

    * --enable-mods-shared="foo1 foo2" is busted on Darwin.  Pier
        posted a patch (Message-ID: <B8DBBE8D.575A%pier@betaversion.org>).

    * We do not properly substitute the prefix-variables in the configuration
      scripts or generated-configs.  (i.e. if sysconfdir is etc,
      httpd-std.conf points to conf.)

    * If any request gets through ap_process_request_internal() and is
      scheduled to be served by the core handler, without a flag that this 
      r->filename was tested by dir/file_walk, we need to 500 at the very 
      end of the ap_process_request_internal() processing so sub_req-esters
      know this request cannot be run.  This provides authors of older 
      modules better compatibility, while still improving the security and 
      robustness of 2.0. 

        Status: still need to decide where this goes, OtherBill comments...
        Message-ID: <065701c14526$495203b0$96c0b0d0@roweclan.net>
        [Deleted comments regarding the ap_run_handler phase, as irrelevant
            as BillS points out that "common case will be caught in
  	    default_handler already (with the r->finfo.filetype == 0 check)"
            and the issue is detecting this -before- we try to run the req.]

	gregames says: can this happen somehow without a broken module
            being involved?  If not, why waste cycles trying to defend against
            potential broken modules?  It seems futile.
        wrowe counters: no, it shouldn't happen unless the module is broken.
            But the right answer is to fail the request up-front in dir/file
            walk if the path was entirely invalid; and we can't do that either
            or we break modules that are unwilling to hook map_to_storage.

    * Rewrite core_output_filter. It is nearly impossible to support
      it with predictable results as it is implemented now.

    * With AP_MODE_EXHAUSTIVE in the core, it is finally clear to me
      how the Perchild MPM should be re-written.  It hasn't worked
      correctly since filters were added because it wasn't possible to
      get the content that had already been written and the socket at
      the same time.  This mode lets us do that, so the MPM can be
      fixed.

    * htpasswd blindly processes the file you give it, and does no
      sanity checking before totally corrupting whatever file it was
      you thought you had. It should check the input file and bail
      if it finds non-comment lines that do not contain exactly 1
      ':' character.
        Message-ID: <20020217150457.A31632@clove.org>

    * Can a static httpd be built reliably?
        Message-ID: <20020207142751.T31582@clove.org>

    * [Ken] Test suite failures:
      o worker is also failing some of the 'cgi' subtests
      (see <URL:http://Source-Zone.Org/Apache/regression/>):
        Justin says: "Worker should be fine and passes httpd-test here.
                      If you can provide evidence that it can be reproduced
                      outside of httpd-test, then it's a showstopper.  I
                      think it's a perl or a httpd-test problem."
        Not a showstopper: Justin

    * Usage of APR_BRIGADE_NORMALIZE in core_input_filter should be
      removed if possible.
        Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0201202232430.318-100000@deepthought.cs.virginia.edu>
        Jeff wonders if we still care about this.  It is no longer an
        API issue but simply an extra trip through the brigade.

    * There is a bug in how we sort some hooks, at least the pre-config
      hook.  The first time we call the hooks, they are in the correct 
      order, but the second time, we don't sort them correctly.  Currently,
      the modules/http/config.m4 file has been renamed to 
      modules/http/config2.m4 to work around this problem, it should moved
      back when this is fixed.    rbb
        Justin says: "Is this really a showstopper?  This has been here
                      forever.  What's wrong?  Does this have to do with
                      autoconf or m4?"
        Not a showstopper: Justin, BrianP, trawick, gregames

    * The Add...Filter and Set...Filter directives do not allow the
      administrator to order filters, beyond the order of filename (mime)
      extensions.  It isn't clear if Set...Filter(s) should be inserted 
      before or after the Add...Filter(s) which are ordered by sequence of
      filename extensions.  At minimum, some sort of +-[0-10] syntax seems
      like the quickest fix for a 2.0 gold release.
        Justin says: "Could we delay this for a point release or 2.1?"
        Not a showstopper: justin, wrowe, trawick, stoddard, Jim, Ian, Aaron,
                           gregames

    * Get perchild to work on platforms other than Linux. This
      will require a portable mechanism to pass data and file/socket
      descriptors between vhost child groups. An API was proposed
      on dev@apr:
        Message-ID: <20020111115006.K1529@clove.org>

    * Try to get libtool inter-library dependency code working on AIX.
        Message-ID: <cm3n10lx555.fsf@rdu163-40-092.nc.rr.com>

      Justin says: If we get it working on AIX, we can enable this
                   on all platforms and clean up our build system
                   somewhat.
      Jeff says:   I thought I tested a patch for you sometime in
                   January that you were going to commit within a few
                   days.

    * Handling of %2f in URIs.  Currently both 1.3 and 2.0
      completely disallow %2f in the request URI path (see
      ap_unescape_url() in util.c).  It's permitted and passed
      through in the query string, however.  Roy says the
      original reason for disallowing it, from five years ago,
      was to protect CGI scripts that applied PATH_INFO to
      a filesystem location and which might be tricked by
      ..%2f..%2f(...).  We *should* allow path-info of the
      form 'http://foo.com/index.cgi/path/to/path%2finfo'.
      Since we've revamped a lot of our processing of path
      segments, it would be nice to allow this, or at least
      allow it conditionally with a directive.

    * FreeBSD, threads, and worker MPM.  All seems to work fine 
      if you only have one worker process with many threads.  Add 
      a second worker process and the accept lock seems to be
      lost.  This might be an APR issue with how it deals with
      the child_init hook (i.e. the fcntl lock needs to be resynced).
      More examination and analysis is required.
        Status: This has also been reported on Cygwin.  
        Message-ID: <3C2CC514.8EF3BED1@wapme-systems.de> (cygnus)

      Justin says: So, FreeBSD-CURRENT and Cywin have the same 
                   problem.  Yum.  If another platform has this
                   with worker, this becomes a showstopper.
      Aaron says: I spent some time disecting this and have come to
              the conclusion that it is not a problem in the worker MPM
              (or at least, it is not isolated to a problem in worker).
              I'll list some of the problems I'm seeing in case someone
              else wants to pick up where I've left off:
               - Delivery of just about any signal to one of the child
                 processes will send it into an infinite loop as well.
               - Even though the parent is spinning out of control,
                 at first the child or children will appear to work
                 properly. At times it is possible to get it into a state,
                 however, where a request will hang until another concurrent
                 request "kicks" the first, at which point the second will
                 hang. My theory is that this has to do with the
                 pthread_cond_*() implementation in FreeBSD, but it's still
                 possible that it is in APR.
      
      Justin adds: Oh, FreeBSD threads are implemented entirely with 
                   select()/poll()/longjmp().  Welcome to the nightmare.
                   So, that means a ktrace output also has the thread 
                   scheduling internals in it (since it is all the same to 
                   the kernel).  Which makes it hard to distinguish between 
                   our select() calls and their select() calls.  
                   *bangs head on wall repeatedly*  But, some of the libc_r 
                   files have a DBG_MSG #define.  This is moderately helpful
                   when used with -DNO_DETACH.  The kernel scheduler isn't 
                   waking up the threads on a select().  Yum.  And, I bet 
                   those decrementing select calls have to do with the 
                   scheduler.  Time to brush up on our OS fundamentals.

    * There is increasing demand from module writers for an API
      that will allow them to control the server à la apachectl.
      Reasons include sole-function servers that need to die if
      an external dependency (e.g., a database) fails, et cetera.
      Perhaps something in the (ever more abused) scoreboard?
        rbb: I don't believe the scoreboard is the correct mechanism
             for this.  We already have a pipe that goes between parent
             and child for graceful shutdown events, along with an API that
             can be used to send a message down that pipe.  In threaded MPMs,
             it is easy enough to make that one pipe be used for graceful
             and graceless events, and it is also easy to open that pipe
             to both parent and child for writing.  Then we just need to
             figure out how to do graceless on non-threaded MPMs.

    * Allow the DocumentRoot directive within <Location > scopes?  This
      allows the beloved (crusty) Alias /foo/ /somepath/foo/ followed
      by a <Directory /somepath/foo> to become simply 
      <Location /foo/> DocumentRoot /somefile/foo (IMHO a bit more legible
      and in-your-face.)  DocumentRoot unset would be accepted [and would
      not permit content to be served, only virtual resources such as
      server-info or server-status.
        This proposed change would _not_ depricate Alias.

    * Win32: Rotatelogs sometimes is not terminated when Apache
      goes down hard.  FirstBill was looking at possibly tracking the 
      child's-child processes in the parent process.
        OtherBill asks, wasn't this fixed? 
        stoddard: Not fixed. Shared scoreboard might offer a good
        way for the parent to keep track of 'other child' processes
        and whack them if the child goes down.
        Other thoughts on walking the process chain using the NT kernel
        have also been proposed on APR.

    * Win32: Add a simple hold console open patch (wait for close or
        the ESC key, with a nice message) if the server died a bad 
        death (non-zero exit code) in console mode.
        Resolution: bring forward same ugly hacks from 1.3.13-.20
        This is not so simple.  Any exit() from APR or other libraries
        can't be caught unless we add some sort of apr_exit(rv) with
        registered apr_atexit() fn's that have the return code as an
        argument to the registered fn.

    * Eliminate unnecessary creation of pipes in mod_cgid

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * Document mod_file_cache.

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Architect start-up code that avoids initializing all the modules 
      in the parent process on platforms that do not support fork.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
      the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
      necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
      rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
      for predictable mod_auth_dbm administration.
        Questions; htdbm exists, time to kill dbmmanage, or does it remain
                   useful as a perl dbm management example?  If we keep it,
                   do we address the issue above?

    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
        - case_preserved_filename stuff
            (use the new canonical name stuff?)
        - find a new home for ap_text(_header)
        - is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * callers of ap_run_create_request() should check the return value
      for failure (Doug volunteers)

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
        (at least) needs to be done:
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)  This could be resolved with an SSL library, or
        randomization in APR itself.
        - Bring the Win9xConHook.dll from 1.3 into 2.0 (no sense till it
        actually works) and add in a splash of Win9x service code.

    * Fix the worker MPM to use POD to kill child processes instead
      of ap_os_killpg, regardless of how they should die. (Ryan Bloom)

    * Scoreboard structures could be changed in the future such that
      proper alignment is not maintained, leading to segfaults on 
      some systems.  Cliff posted a patch to deal with this issue but
      later recanted. See this message to dev@apr.apache.org:
      Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0203011354090.16457-200000@deepthought

TODO ISSUES REMAINING IN MOD_SSL:

    * In order to use a DSO version of mod_ssl we have to link with
      -lssl and -lcrypto. A workaround is in place right now where the
      entire EXTRA_LIBS macro is being appended to the objects list, but
      this is a hack. We should either revamp the APACHE_CHECK_SSL_TOOLKIT
      autoconf function or come up with some other autoconf checks to
      search for libssl and libcrypto and properly add them to mod_ssl's
      link flags.

    * SSL renegotiations in combination with POST request

    * Port or dispose all code inside #if 0...#endif blocks that remain
      from the porting effort.

    * Do we need SSL_set_read_ahead()?

    * the ssl_expr api is NOT THREAD SAFE.  race conditions exist:
       -in ssl_expr_comp() if SSLRequire is used in .htaccess
        (ssl_expr_info is global)
       -is ssl_expr_eval() if there is an error
        (ssl_expr_error is global)

    * SSLRequire directive (parsing of) leaks memory

    * Diffie-Hellman-Parameters for temporary keys are hardcoded in
      ssl_engine_dh.c, while the comment in ssl_engine_kernel.c says:
      "it is suggested that keys be changed daily or every 500
      transactions, and more often if possible."

    * ssl_var_lookup could be rewritten to be MUCH faster

    * CRL callback should be pluggable

    * session cache store should be pluggable

    * init functions should return status code rather than ssl_die()

    * ssl_engine_pphrase.c needs to be reworked so it is generic enough
      to also decrypt proxy keys

    * the shmcb code should just align its memory segment rather than
      jumping through all the "safe" memcpy and memset hoops


EXPERIMENTAL MODULES:

    Experimental modules should eventually be be promoted to fully supported
    status or removed from the repository entirely (ie, the
    'experiment' failed). This section tracks what needs to happen to 
    get the modules promoted to fully supported status.

    mod_cache/mod_mem_cache/mod_disk_cache:

    * mod_cache: handle cache_control: no_cache "field_name" to enable 
      cacheing the response w/o header "field_name"
      See RFC2616 section 14.9.1

    * mod_cache: CacheEnable/CacheDisable should accept regular expressions.

    * mod_cache: Fix dependency on ATOMIC operators. Need
      APR_HAS_ATOMIC_* feature macros.

    * mod_disk_cache: Implement garbage collection

    * mod_mem_cache/mod_disk_cache: Need to be able to query cache
      status (num of entries, cache object properties, etc.).
      mod_status could be extended to query optional hooks defined
      by modules for the purpose of reporting module status.
      mod_cache (et. al.) could define optional hooks that are called
      to collect status.  Status should be queryable by
      HTTP or SNMP?

    * mod_mem_cache: garbage collection. One strategy is to simply
      remove stale entries as we attempt to serve them. Another
      strategy is to kick off a GC thread that traverses the cache
      and preemptively remove stale entries.  How to manage a 
      cache that is full? Do LRU GC? Other? Bueller?

    * mod_mem_cache/mod_disk_cache: Complete implementing config
      directives. 

    * Sample config for mod_cache/mod_mem_cache/mod_disk_cache for
      inclusion into httpd.conf.

    * mod_cache/mod_mem_cache/mod_disk_cache: Documentation.

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * ap_discard_request should be converted to use the bucket API
      directly rather than waste cycles copying buffers with the old API.

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.
        OtherBill suggests: We at least seem to agree on eliminating
                            the <Container ~ foo> forms, and using only
                            <ContainerMatch foo> semantics.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

    * orig_ct in the byterange/multipart handling may not be
      needed. Apache 1.3 just never stashed "multipart" into
      r->content_type. We should probably follow suit since the
      byterange stuff doesn't want the rest of the code to see the
      multipart content-type; the other code should still think it is
      dealing with the <orig_ct> stuff.
        Status: Greg volunteers to investigate (esp. since he was most 
                likely the one to break it :-)
