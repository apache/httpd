CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

      Patch submitted by Olivier Thereaux

    * mod_deflate: don't choke on flush buckets in INFLATE filter
      PR#39854
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=416165&view=rev
      +1: niq
      -0: wrowe - on quick glance the line 1091 change looks incomplete,
          and I'm not convinced that we should ignore flush.  Has anyone
          inquired of the proper mechanism or composed the appropriate
          patch to finish an incomplete packet and resume encoding or
          this entirely impossible in the current scheme of things?
      rpluem: I discussed this with Justin at the ApacheCon and we discussed
              ways how to fix this and take care about the flush buckets.
              I am willing to propose patches, but due to personal time
              constraints they will not show up before the second half of July.

    * worker and event MPMs: fix excessive forking if fork() or child_init 
      take a long time.  PR 39275.
