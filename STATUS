CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.0.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.0.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes in STATUS, and then merge into branches/2.0.x.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Various fixes to T-E and C-L processing from trunk

      Refactor mod_proxy_http.c's Transfer-Encoding/Content-Length elections
      since they didn't follow RFC 2616, in fact didn't seem to make much
      sense at all.  Patch to migrate request-body-handling from trunk/ based
      on 2.1-dev request body handling behavior (although just a bit more
      conservative on the side of C-L spooling)...
          http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/httpd-2.0-proxy-request-3.patch
      Revert r219061 to properly test this patch, as r219061 masks the
      underlying bug (although it is a -good- patch in and of itself).

       +1: wrowe, jim
       -1: jorton: this is a massive patch and extremely hard to review
           for actual interesting content; it is mixed in with all sorts
           of unrelated stuff.  It needs to at least be split up or
           the unrelated stuff removed.

           unrelated change: s/apr_strnatcasecmp/strcasecmp/
           unrelated change: s/b/bb/ on variable+parameter names a few times
           unrelated change: whitespaces changes all over the shop
           spurious change:? send_request_body() appears to have been inlined
           unrelated change: Via header handling

         trawick noted on list: we elected C-L not for efficiency, but because
                 it's the most widely supported [paraphrasing]
         wrowe   notes: I agree - this new patch always chooses C-L for any
                 C-L body received.  If the origin kicks out LENGTH_REQUIRED
                 for a T-E body it's always up to the client to react.
                 Note proxy-sendchunks can override this behavior.
         roy     Notes on list: we must always prefer C-L if it's going to fit
                 in our brigade.
         wrowe   good point; the revised patch prereads MAX_MEM_SPOOL and will
                 try reading that before choosing C-L or T-E.
         wrowe   adds; After testing, I've determined one brigade isn't enough,
                 so I've extended this to a loop up to MAX_MEM_SPOOL, we will
                 fetch up enough body to fill MAX_MEM_SPOOL and hopefully
                 hit the C-L code path most of the time.

         trawick We are counting bytes in stream_reqbody_cl but filters can
                 change the size? [p]
         wrowe   Yes - which is why the patch prefers spool_reqbody_cl unless
                 the filter stack is unchanged from proto_input_filters.  The
                 protocol filters shouldn't be changing content size.  And when
                 it happens, we have to barf or we have a split request.
                 The old behavior was worse; we would stream the request body
                 in additional cases without looking to see if the byte count
                 matched Content-Length.  Easy opportunity for split requests.

         trawick What specifically was done for conformance to RFC 2616? [p]
         wrowe   Elect the appropriate body handling, and ensure that body
                 request contains the required *single* T-E or C-L header,
                 and there are far few code paths to stream_reqbody_cl which
                 was most likely to create split requests by reporting the
                 wrong C-L.

         trawick Please split philosophy from rfc violations from security 
                 fixes in the CHANGES log? [p]
         wrowe   The others are all a bit to intertwined, the Watchfire report 
                 spelled out that it's different behavior and RFC 2616 deviations 
                 that cause the vulnerability, so I don't see how we can divide 
                 the issues of correctly sending the body and choosing the
                 transport flavor.

    * http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=171205&view=rev [committed]
      backport this fix from 2.1-dev:
      proxy HTTP: Rework the handling of request bodies to handle
      chunked input and input filters which modify content length, and
      avoid spooling arbitrary-sized request bodies in memory.
      PR: 15859

        +1 trawick, jerenkrantz, jim
        -1 wrowe
           This patch needs to be reverted or ammended by the patch above;
           this resulting code is more complex, yet equally faulty in it's
           C-L/T-E elections for a number of specific cases.  No opinion
           between the choice of reverting and re-backporting, or simply
           patching-the-patch.

    * TRACE must not have a request body per RFC2616; see the -trace.patch
      below for one of two alternatives.  The other alternative; simply
      hack mod_proxy.c to reject TRACE when a body is seen, again see that
      -trace.patch for an illustration.


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ please append new backports at the end of this list not the top. ]

    *) several changes to improve logging of connection-oriented errors, including
       ap_log_cerror() API (needs minor bump in addition to changes below)
         http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/core.c?r1=1.289&r2=1.291
         http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/log.c?r1=1.150&r2=1.151
         http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/include/http_log.h?r1=1.46&r2=1.48
       +1: trawick, stoddard, wrowe 
       [wrowe notes that his previous objection is moot, based on security fixes
        applied between .44 and .54 - but -please- doxygen the version of Apache
        required in the API header note, for users who adopt this alternative.]

    *) mod_cgi: Added API call and overload of detached field in
       cgi_exec_info_t structure to support loading in current or new address
       space for CGIs.  The patch change how NetWare use cmdtype for
       processes. It was made necessary by changes done to log.c r1.145.
       The HTTP and the APR patches are available at:
       <http://www.apache.org/~clar/detach-addrspace_HTTP_2_0.patch>
       <http://www.apache.org/~clar/detach-addrspace_APR_0_9.patch>
       +1: jjclar, bnicholes, trawick
       jerenkrantz: I'm confused as to the status of this backport.
       trawick: Somebody commits the APR 0.9 patch, then:
         do we have to wait for later APR 0.x release before putting
         calls to apr_procattr_addrspace_set() into httpd-2.0.x, or
         do we go ahead and introduce the prerequisite?
       clar replies: I am ready to commit the apr 0.9.x patch, but then will need 
         the changes in the httpd-2.0.x to be done in order for NetWare to work
         as expected when calling apr_proc_create. Should I do both, APR and Http,
         at the same time?
       wrowe: commit to APR.  Use an APR version test *in httpd* to determine 
         if the old or new behavior should be used in httpd.  In future versions
         you could remove the test altogether.

    *) mod_actions: Regression from 1.3: the file referred to must exist.
       Solve this by introducing the "virtual" modifier to the Action
       directive. PR 28553.
         modules/mappers/mod_actions.c: r1.32, r1.34
       jerenkrantz: Icky side-effect of the *t == '0' check.
       +1: nd, jerenkrantz, wrowe, jim
       -0: by rbb (inconsistent to 1.3, discussion on dev@)
          nd: I'm going to reverse the default
          jerenkrantz, striker: I'm confused as to the status of this backport.

    * support/check_forensic: Fix tempfile usage
      svn rev 125495, 126224
      jerenkrantz says: r126224 fixes brokenness with r125495 on Solaris.
      +1: thommay, jerenkrantz, trawick
      trawick: "which" isn't portable; I've suggested a work-around on dev@
        (not standing in way of backport)
      jorton said: NetBSD's which isn't sufficient either.
      jerenkrantz: Since it's not in the critical path (and depends on
                   mod_log_forensic), I think it's still worth it to backport
                   it as-is.  For the one or two platforms that don't like 
                   which, they can write their own version of the script.

    * Win32: Move call to mpm_service_install to the rewrite_args hook
      from the post_config hook.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?view=rev&rev=154319
      +1: stoddard, striker, wrowe (as corrected in subsequent patches)

    * mod_version: New Module, Backport from trunk. Requires Minor MMN Bump.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ please place SVN revisions from trunk here, so it is easy to
    identify exactly what the proposed changes are! ]

    *) Correct RFC 2616 non-compliance by refusing to proxy a request body 
       in a TRACE request, unless TraceEnable extended is configured.
       Introduces TraceEnable [on|off|extended] to give the administrator
       full control of TRACE request handling.  RFC 2616 does NOT require
       TRACE (although to disable remains silly).  Current patch at;
          http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/httpd-2.0-trace.patch
       +1 wrowe, jimjag

    *) mod_headers: Support {...}s tag for SSL variable lookup.
       http://www.apache.org/~jorton/mod_headers-2.0-ssl.diff
       +1: jorton, trawick
       nd: two comments:
         (1) is the use of APR_ASCII_* ebcdic-safe? I.e. shouldn't we use the
             native chars here and it will be converted later? (I'm not sure)
       jorton: I have no idea, let an EBCDIC-er complain if it breaks?
       trawick: seems that '\r' and '\n' are the better chars to check
                for; this is not raw data read from the network (or directly
                from SSL) but instead it is either protocol data that has 
                already been converted to the native charset or it is other
                data which was created inside the server in the native charset
         (2) I'd put out (null) only if val is NULL, not if it's empty.
       jorton: ssl_var_lookup() returns "" in place of NULL, that was really
          a deliberate choice... but maybe you're right.

    *) mod_log_config: Cleanup log_header_out function to allow multiple headers
       like Set-Cookie to be logged properly. PR 27787 (2.0 + 1.3)
         modules/loggers/mod_log_config.c: r1.116
       jerenkrantz asks: Isn't this what apr_table_merge is for?
       nd replies: yep. But cookies won't be merged, because browsers don't
                   support it.
       jerenkrantz: Couldn't we copy the table and merge the values somehow?
                    This just seems like a lot of code to duplicate what we
                    have already.  *shrug*  Regardless, patch looks okay...
       +1: nd, jerenkrantz

    *) Provide TLS/SSL upgrade functionality in mod_ssl allowing an unsecure
       connection to be upgraded to a secure connection upon request by the
       client.  The full patch file is available at http://www.apache.org/~bnicholes/
       as well as a test client tlsupgrade.c. This functionality is mainly used by
       IPP clients today.

                   the ldap sdk (openldap etc) linked in, and our --static-support
                   stuff is horribly broken by this change.  Not that it's wrong,
                   we need to look at making it slightly more dynamic for those
                   apps that don't touch ldap.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * There is a bug in how we sort some hooks, at least the pre-config
      hook.  The first time we call the hooks, they are in the correct 
      order, but the second time, we don't sort them correctly.  Currently,
      the modules/http/config.m4 file has been renamed to 
      modules/http/config2.m4 to work around this problem, it should moved
      back when this is fixed.

        OtherBill offers that this is a SERIOUS problem.  We do not sort
        correctly by the ordering arguments passed to the register hook
        functions.  This was proven when I reordered the open_logs hook
        to attempt to open the error logs prior to the access logs.  Possibly
        the entire sorting code needs to be refactored.

    * pipes deadlock on all platforms with limited pipe buffers (e.g. both
      Linux and Win32, as opposed to only Win32 on 1.3).  The right solution
      is either GStein's proposal for a "CGI Brigade", or OtherBill's proposal
      for "Poll Buckets" for "Polling Filter Chains".  Or perhaps both :-)

    * All handlers should always send content down even if r->header_only
      is set.  If not, it means that the HEAD requests don't generate the
      same headers as a GET which is wrong.

    * HP/UX 10.20: compile breakage in APR.  Looks like it should be easy
      to fix, probably just some extraneous #include's that are fouling
      things up.
      PR: 9457
      Jeff: See my reply and patch in the PR (and previous commit to
      stop using "pipe" as a field name).  If patch is committed, we
      should be okay.  I'll wait to see if the user tests the patch.
      Update by Jeff 20020722: I got an account on HP 10.20.  It looks
      like some of the APR thread detection is screwed up.  If we find
      pthread.h but we can't compile the pthread test program we still
      think we can use threads.  For that reason, the patch I posted
      to the PR won't work as-is since a failed compile of the test
      program means nothing.

    * exec cmd and suexec arg-passing enhancements

    * The 2.0.36 worker MPM graceless shutdown changes work but are
      a bit clunky on some platforms; eg, on Linux, the loop to
      join each worker thread seems to hang, and the parent ends up
      killing off the child with SIGKILL.  But at least it shuts down.

    * --enable-mods-shared="foo1 foo2" is busted on Darwin.  Pier
        posted a patch (Message-ID: <B8DBBE8D.575A%pier@betaversion.org>).

    * We do not properly substitute the prefix-variables in the configuration
      scripts or generated-configs.  (i.e. if sysconfdir is etc,
      httpd-std.conf points to conf.)

    * If any request gets through ap_process_request_internal() and is
      scheduled to be served by the core handler, without a flag that this 
      r->filename was tested by dir/file_walk, we need to 500 at the very 
      end of the ap_process_request_internal() processing so sub_req-esters
      know this request cannot be run.  This provides authors of older 
      modules better compatibility, while still improving the security and 
      robustness of 2.0. 

        Status: still need to decide where this goes, OtherBill comments...
        Message-ID: <065701c14526$495203b0$96c0b0d0@roweclan.net>
        [Deleted comments regarding the ap_run_handler phase, as irrelevant
            as BillS points out that "common case will be caught in
  	    default_handler already (with the r->finfo.filetype == 0 check)"
            and the issue is detecting this -before- we try to run the req.]

	gregames says: can this happen somehow without a broken module
            being involved?  If not, why waste cycles trying to defend against
            potential broken modules?  It seems futile.
        wrowe counters: no, it shouldn't happen unless the module is broken.
            But the right answer is to fail the request up-front in dir/file
            walk if the path was entirely invalid; and we can't do that either
            UNTIL 2.1 or we break modules that haven't hooked map_to_storage.

    * With AP_MODE_EXHAUSTIVE in the core, it is finally clear to me
      how the Perchild MPM should be re-written.  It hasn't worked
      correctly since filters were added because it wasn't possible to
      get the content that had already been written and the socket at
      the same time.  This mode lets us do that, so the MPM can be
      fixed.

    * htpasswd blindly processes the file you give it, and does no
      sanity checking before totally corrupting whatever file it was
      you thought you had. It should check the input file and bail

                      I think it's a perl or a httpd-test problem."

    * Usage of APR_BRIGADE_NORMALIZE in core_input_filter should be

        Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0201202232430.318-100000@deepthought.cs.virginia.edu>
        Jeff wonders if we still care about this.  It is no longer an
        API issue but simply an extra trip through the brigade.

    * The Add...Filter and Set...Filter directives do not allow the
      administrator to order filters, beyond the order of filename (mime)
      extensions.  It isn't clear if Set...Filter(s) should be inserted 
      before or after the Add...Filter(s) which are ordered by sequence of
      filename extensions.  At minimum, some sort of +-[0-10] syntax seems
      like a nice solution.  See ROADMAP.

    * Get perchild to work on platforms other than Linux. This
      will require a portable mechanism to pass data and file/socket
      descriptors between vhost child groups. An API was proposed
      on dev@apr:

    * Try to get libtool inter-library dependency code working on AIX.
        Message-ID: <cm3n10lx555.fsf@rdu163-40-092.nc.rr.com>

      Justin says: If we get it working on AIX, we can enable this
                   on all platforms and clean up our build system
                   somewhat.
      Jeff says:   I thought I tested a patch for you sometime in
                   January that you were going to commit within a few
                   days.

    * Handling of %2f in URIs.  Currently both 1.3 and 2.0
      completely disallow %2f in the request URI path (see
      ap_unescape_url() in util.c).  It's permitted and passed
      through in the query string, however.  Roy says the
      original reason for disallowing it, from five years ago,
      was to protect CGI scripts that applied PATH_INFO to
      a filesystem location and which might be tricked by
      ..%2f..%2f(...).  We *should* allow path-info of the
      form 'http://foo.com/index.cgi/path/to/path%2finfo'.
      Since we've revamped a lot of our processing of path
      segments, it would be nice to allow this, or at least
      allow it conditionally with a directive.

        OtherBill adds that %2f as the SECOND character of a multibyte
        sequence causes the request to fail!  This happens notably in
        the ja-jis encoding.

      OtherBill is -0.5 for even considering this until 2.2 because
      it removes some protection we provided to third party modules
      that would mysteriously 'evaporate', exposing potential holes
      in security.  Putting this change into 2.1 development now (with
      strong warnings!) will give authors a chance to vet their code.

    * There is increasing demand from module writers for an API
      that will allow them to control the server à la apachectl.
      Reasons include sole-function servers that need to die if
      an external dependency (e.g., a database) fails, et cetera.
      Perhaps something in the (ever more abused) scoreboard?
        
             On the other hand, we already have a pipe that goes between parent
             and child for graceful shutdown events, along with an API that
             can be used to send a message down that pipe.  In threaded MPMs,
             it is easy enough to make that one pipe be used for graceful
             and graceless events, and it is also easy to open that pipe
             to both parent and child for writing.  Then we just need to
             figure out how to do graceless on non-threaded MPMs.

    * Win32: Rotatelogs sometimes is not terminated when Apache
      goes down hard.  FirstBill was looking at possibly tracking the 
      child's-child processes in the parent process.
        stoddard: Shared scoreboard might offer a good way for the parent 
        to keep track of 'other child' processes and whack them if the child 
        goes down.
        Other thoughts on walking the process chain using the NT kernel
        have also been proposed on APR.

    * Eliminate unnecessary creation of pipes in mod_cgid

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
      the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
      necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
      rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
      for predictable mod_auth_dbm administration.
        Questions; htdbm exists, time to kill dbmmanage, or does it remain
                   useful as a perl dbm management example?  If we keep it,
                   do we address the issue above?
        March discussion summary; we are missing group support.  With that
                   added to trunk, this script will go away.  It will remain
                   in 2.0 based on our versioning approach.

    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
        - case_preserved_filename stuff
            (use the new canonical name stuff?)
        - find a new home for ap_text(_header)
        - is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)
        OtherBill adds that the 'good' solution of three passes against the
        config tree within one read is the better solution, but breaks many
        modules.  Best left for 2.2?
        -0.5:  OtherBill

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * callers of ap_run_create_request() should check the return value
      for failure (Doug volunteers)

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
        (at least) needs to be done:
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)  This could be resolved with an SSL library, or
        randomization in APR itself.
        - Bring the Win9xConHook.dll from 1.3 into 2.0 (no sense till it
        actually works) and add in a splash of Win9x service code.

    * Fix the worker MPM to use POD to kill child processes instead
      of ap_os_killpg, regardless of how they should die.

    * Scoreboard structures could be changed in the future such that
      proper alignment is not maintained, leading to segfaults on 
      some systems.  Cliff posted a patch to deal with this issue but
      later recanted. See this message to dev@apr.apache.org:
      Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0203011354090.16457-200000@deepthought
                  .cs.virginia.edu>

    * ap_discard_request should be converted to use the bucket API
      directly rather than waste cycles copying buffers with the old API.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.


EXPERIMENTAL MODULES:

    mod_auth_ldap/util_ldap:
    * General stabilization and testing
    
    * Fix the shared memory cache
