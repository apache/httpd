CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
            http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=571798
            http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=571804
     +1: minfrin
     rpluem says: r466865 has a conflict in modules/aaa/mod_auth.h
                  r571804 has a conflict in docs/manual/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.xml
                  Without r571838 the documentation for mod_authn_dbd fails
                  to build.

    * multiple files,	Trivial cleanups
      PR: 39518 - Christophe JAILLET
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=557837

      +1: rpluem
      niq: this isn't a straight backport (which is why I dropped it).
      +1 for core, modules/dav, modules/filters, and modules/ssl
      Not Applicable to modules/aaa

   * mod_include: Add an "if" directive syntax to test whether an URL
     is accessible, and if so, conditionally display content. This
     allows a webmaster to hide a link to a private page when the user
     has no access to that page.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

    * mod_ldap, mod_authnzldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
      to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
      where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
      PR: 42891
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=560373
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=562165
      A version of the patch specific to the 2.2 branch (i.e. the patch that
      would be used for backport) can be found at:
      http://people.apache.org/~rederpj/NestedGroups_2.2.xBranch.diff 
      +1: rederpj
      -0: bnicholes - Unless this is considered to be a significant deficiency in the
                       authnz_ldap 2.2 functionality, I would rather see this as new
		       functionality going forward in 2.4 rather than backported to
		       2.2. We need new functionality to push us forward rather than
		       give us an excuse to stay where we are.
      rederpj says: I'm working on a project based on Apache 2.2.x which needs this code
          and I would much prefer to use official Apache code than end up using a private
          patch. It isn't possible in the short term for us to move to trunk. It just
          happened that code I had written to add this function lined up with PR 42891.
          I was going to submit it and work to get it backported either way.
      rpluem says: I am still missing a minor bump due to the changes done
      in util_ldap.h. This is an extension of a public API.
      trawick says: The new directives should be documented in trunk,
          so that docs are available for backport at the same time.

    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mpm_winnt_waits.patch
        is easier to read (-U8)
      +1: mturk
      +0: fielding (patch is okay, underlying code is crap)
      wrowe notes: a patch should have the necessary effect with the
        minimum lines of code - there's alot of redecorating that's
        going on in this patch to no net effect.  The WAIT_TIMEOUT
        result value seems to be ignored in the revised code?
      mturk notes: WAIT_TIMEOUT is replaced by WAIT_FAILED with
        the accompanied patch in mpm\winnt\child.c.
      fielding notes: the routine is brain-dead -- one cannot replicate
        a wait for many objects by iterating through multiple waits with
        a one second sleep in between loops.  That's insane.
        The right ways to do that are explained in the MSDN article
        <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687025.aspx>
        In any case, it should be checking nCount <= MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS
        first and use the simple wait in that case.
      mturk notes: We are interested in that only during shutdown
        so a one second simplification is acceptable compromise.
        The sole purpose of the patch is to allow the clean shutdown
        when the MaxClients is higher then 257. 
      wrowe: conditional +1 if you rename the assanine function name
        so no one confuses it for its implied purpose.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=491922
     2.2.x version of patch:

      sctemme: svn blame suggests r424707

              r424735
              r424821
              r424823

              and follow ups for more details.

    * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml?r1=420990&r2=421725 (docs)
      +1: niq, mturk
      -1: wrowe notes; modifying the existing syntax makes collaboration 
          impossible by an admin team - unexpected side effects and the rest.
          ProxyPassEnv* or ProxyPassSubstitute* directives that add this
          behavior on a pattern-by-pattern basis would win my -1 to a +1,
          and solve the performance hits noted by niq on an 80/20 basis.
