CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
