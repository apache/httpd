RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * mod_rewrite's locks (win32) were broken by recent changes to the 
      apr_lock_t api (which we were deprecating in the first place, so
      I'm far from certain why it changed.)  It has to do with creating
      the rewrite logs mutex.  The solution is to find the brokenness in 
      apr_lock_t, but if it goes away, why waste the time?

    * ap_directory_walk skips some per-dir config merge functions
      if there is no "<Directory />" block in the configuration
        Message-ID: <m3itbdiijq.fsf@rdu163-40-092.nc.rr.com>
        * That is very unlikely, merges are additive.  Much more likely,
          the default SetOutputFilter default or merge is borked.
          Unless it's the code that permits 'null' merges, per module.
          Still, it's probably in SetOutputFilter's behavior.

    * Test suite failures:
      o perchild doesn't even build
      o worker is also failing some of the 'cgi' subtests
      (see <URL:http://Source-Zone.Org/Apache/regression/>):

    * If any request gets to the core handler, without a flag that this 
      r->filename was tested by dir/file_walk, we need to 500 at the very 
      end of the ap_process_request_internal() processing.  This provides
      authors of older modules better compatibility, while still improving
      the security and robustness of 2.0. 
        Status: still need to decide where this goes, OtherBill comments...
        Message-ID: <065701c14526$495203b0$96c0b0d0@roweclan.net>
        we need to look at halting this in the 'default handler' case,
        and that implies pushing the 'handler election' into the request
        internal processing phase from the run request phase.

    * There is a bug in how we sort some hooks, at least the pre-config
      hook.  The first time we call the hooks, they are in the correct 
      order, but the second time, we don't sort them correctly.  Currently,
      the modules/http/config.m4 file has been renamed to 
      modules/http/config2.m4 to work around this problem, it should moved
      back when this is fixed.    rbb

    * The Add...Filter and Set...Filter directives do not allow the
      administrator to order filters, beyond the order of filename (mime)
      extensions.  It isn't clear if Set...Filter(s) should be inserted 
      before or after the Add...Filter(s) which are ordered by sequence of
      filename extensions.  At minimum, some sort of +-[0-10] syntax seems
      like the quickest fix for a 2.0 gold release.

    * Convert all instances of the old apr_lock_t type to the new
      types (once they are fully supported in APR).
        Status: Aaron is working on converting INTRAPROCESS
                to apr_thread_mutex_t types. Full replacements for
                LOCKALL and CROSS_PROCESS are not yet complete on all
                platforms, and should only be used in MPMs like worker
                with limited OS exposure.

    * A binbuild installation picks up the right libraries when
      running apachectl because we set the appropriate environment
      variable, but ab, htpasswd, etc. don't know how to pick up apr,
      apr-util, etc.
        Message-ID: <20020116000226.GA15991@ebuilt.com>

    * Redirected autoindex requests no longer work. Example:
      http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/  mod_dir is a suspect.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Modify the worker MPM so that it doesn't need to create and
      destroy a pool for each request--possibly by adopting a
      leader/follower model in which each worker owns a persistent
      ptrans pool (like the prefork MPM) and the workers take
      turns acting as listeners...this approach might also help
      reduce context-switching

    * CGI single-byte reads
      BrianP suggests that this is caused by the ap_scan_script_header_err()
      routine, which will do single-byte reads until it finds the end
      of the header, at which point it constructs a pipe-bucket (buffered)
      to read from.

      Proposed solution in:
        Message-ID: <3C36ADAF.60601@cnet.com>

    * Try to get libtool inter-library dependency code working on AIX.

        Message-ID: <cm3n10lx555.fsf@rdu163-40-092.nc.rr.com>

      Justin says: If we get it working on AIX, we can enable this
                   on all platforms and clean up our build system
                   somewhat.

    * Handling of %2f in URIs.  Currently both 1.3 and 2.0
      completely disallow %2f in the request URI path (see
      ap_unescape_url() in util.c).  It's permitted and passed
      through in the query string, however.  Roy says the
      original reason for disallowing it, from five years ago,
      was to protect CGI scripts that applied PATH_INFO to
      a filesystem location and which might be tricked by
      ..%2f..%2f(...).  We *should* allow path-info of the
      form 'http://foo.com/index.cgi/path/to/path%2finfo'.
      Since we've revamped a lot of our processing of path
      segments, it would be nice to allow this, or at least
      allow it conditionally with a directive.

    * FreeBSD, threads, and worker MPM.  All seems to work fine 
      if you only have one worker process with many threads.  Add 
      a second worker process and the accept lock seems to be
      lost.  This might be an APR issue with how it deals with
      the child_init hook (i.e. the fcntl lock needs to be resynced).
      More examination and analysis is required.
      Status: This has also been reported on Cygwin.  

      Message-ID: <3C2CC514.8EF3BED1@wapme-systems.de> (cygnus)

      Justin says: So, FreeBSD-CURRENT and Cywin have the same 
                   problem.  Yum.  If another platform has this
                   with worker, this becomes a showstopper.
      Aaron says: I spent some time disecting this and have come to
              the conclusion that it is not a problem in the worker MPM
              (or at least, it is not isolated to a problem in worker).
              I'll list some of the problems I'm seeing in case someone
              else wants to pick up where I've left off:
               - Delivery of just about any signal to one of the child
                 processes will send it into an infinite loop as well.
               - Even though the parent is spinning out of control,
                 at first the child or children will appear to work
                 properly. At times it is possible to get it into a state,
                 however, where a request will hang until another concurrent
                 request "kicks" the first, at which point the second will
                 hang. My theory is that this has to do with the
                 pthread_cond_*() implementation in FreeBSD, but it's still
                 possible that it is in APR.
      
      Justin adds: Oh, FreeBSD threads are implemented entirely with 
                   select()/poll()/longjmp().  Welcome to the nightmare.
                   So, that means a ktrace output also has the thread 
                   scheduling internals in it (since it is all the same to 
                   the kernel).  Which makes it hard to distinguish between 
                   our select() calls and their select() calls.  
                   *bangs head on wall repeatedly*  But, some of the libc_r 
                   files have a DBG_MSG #define.  This is moderately helpful
                   when used with -DNO_DETACH.  The kernel scheduler isn't 
                   waking up the threads on a select().  Yum.  And, I bet 
                   those decrementing select calls have to do with the 
                   scheduler.  Time to brush up on our OS fundamentals.

    * There is increasing demand from module writers for an API
      that will allow them to control the server à la apachectl.
      Reasons include sole-function servers that need to die if
      an external dependency (e.g., a database) fails, et cetera.
      Perhaps something in the (ever more abused) scoreboard?
	rbb:  I don't believe the scoreboard is the correct mechanism
	for this.  We already have a pipe that goes between parent
	and child for graceful shutdown events, along with an API that
	can be used to send a message down that pipe.  In threaded MPMs,
	it is easy enough to make that one pipe be used for graceful
	and graceless events, and it is also easy to open that pipe
	to both parent and child for writing.  Then we just need to figure
	out how to do graceless on non-threaded MPMs.

    * revamp the input filter behavior, per discussions since
      February (and especially at the hackathon last
      April). Specifically, ap_get_brigade will return a brigade with
      *up to* a specific number of bytes, or a "line" of data. The
      read may be blocking or nonblocking. ap_getline() will be
      refactored into apr_brigade_getline(), and then DECHUNK can use
      f->next (ap_getline will always read "top of input stack"). Also 
      fix the bug where request body content will end up closing the
      connection (buggering up persistent conns).
      Status: Justin is working on this as fast as he can.
              The core input filters, HTTP-related filters, mod_ssl, and
              mod_proxy are switched to the new logic.  
              However, ap_getline() still needs to be refactored out.  But, 
              there's a problem there: ap_getline() peeks ahead for MIME
              continuation (first character on line is space or \t) and 
              stores unused data in core_request_config which violates the
              abstraction.  That's cheating.  So, we may not be able to 
              implement this without setting some data aside (yuck!).
              I believe this is OtherBill's main complaint with the current
              filtering.
              AIUI (correct me if I'm wrong!), OtherBill believes we 
              should have a pushback option so that we can return unread 
              data - this would solve this case.  However, my question to 
              him is how do we handle stuff like mod_ssl - we can't "unread"
              data.  So, do we have two brigades for each filter?  An in
              brigade and a returned brigade?  That seems messy.  To
              everyone else, can we refactor ap_getline() without pushback 
              and how?

    * Allow the DocumentRoot directive within <Location > scopes?  This
      allows the beloved (crusty) Alias /foo/ /somepath/foo/ followed
      by a <Directory /somepath/foo> to become simply 
      <Location /foo/> DocumentRoot /somefile/foo (IMHO a bit more legible
      and in-your-face.)  DocumentRoot unset would be accepted [and would
      not permit content to be served, only virtual resources such as
      server-info or server-status.
        This proposed change would _not_ depricate Alias.

    * Win32: Rotatelogs sometimes is not terminated when Apache
      goes down hard.  FirstBill was looking at possibly tracking the 
      child's-child processes in the parent process.
        OtherBill asks, wasn't this fixed?
        OtherBill asks again, what is the status?

    * Win32: Add a simple hold console open patch (wait for close or
        the ESC key, with a nice message) if the server died a bad 
        death (non-zero exit code) in console mode.
        Resolution: bring forward same ugly hacks from 1.3.13-.20

    * Port of mod_ssl to Apache 2.0:

      The current porting state is summarized in modules/ssl/README. The
      remaining work includes:
      (1) stablizing/optimizing the SSL filter logic
      (2) Enabling the various SSL caching mechanisms (shmcb, shmht)
      (3) Enabling SSL extentions
      (4) Trying to seperate the https filter logic from mod_ssl -
          This is to facilitate other modules that wish to use the https
          filter or the mod_ssl logic or both as required.
        Justin: mod_ssl filter logic is redone, so that should be fine.
                Madhu has submitted a patch for SSL caching - however, I
                am -0 on that patch as I *think* we could implement the
                shared memory another way that is much cleaner (i.e.
                treat shmem directly as a dbm via APR routines).  Justin 
                also thinks that the https filter logic may be sufficiently
                decoupled now, but isn't really sure.

    * Performance & Debug: Eliminate most (and perhaps all) of the 
      malloc/free calls in the bucket brigade code.  Need some 
      light weight memory management functions that allow freeing 
      memory (putting it back into a memory pool) when it is no 
      longer needed. Enabling simple debugging features like guard
      bands, double free detection, etc. would be cool but certainly
      not a hard requirement.

          Status: Cliff started to implement this using SMS as has
                  been discussed at length for months, but since
                  SMS is not being used anywhere else in the server,
                  several people expressed the opinion that we should
                  get rid of it entirely, meaning that the buckets
                  need their own memory management (free list) functions.
                  Cliff will implement that this weekend so we at least
                  have something to look at/compare with.

    * Eliminate unnecessary creation of pipes in mod_cgid

    * the autoconf setup should be fixed to default to using the 
      "Apache" layout from config.layout, and each variable settable
      in a layout should be overridable on the command line.  Plus,
      what we do right now just doesn't seem to fully fit into how autoconf
      works, eg. AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT issues.
        Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.20.0104031557420.20876-100000@alive.znep.com>

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * Document mod_file_cache.

    * OS/2: Make mod_status work for spmt_os2 MPM.

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Architect start-up code that avoids initializing all the modules 
      in the parent process on platforms that do not support fork.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
        the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
        for predictable mod_auth_dbm administration.
        Questions; htdbm exists, time to kill dbmmanage, or does it remain
                   useful as a perl dbm management example?  If we keep it,
                   do we address the issue above?

    * use apu_dbm in mod_auth_dbm
        Status: Greg +1 (low-priority volunteer)
        Justin says: "Seems like this is already there, so should we just 
                      remove the other DBM code in that file?  If you want 
                      to use gdbm, or dbm, etc, you should tell apr-util."
        Will says: "bs - I may choose the fastest - most efficient native
                    dbm implementation, for shared proc caches, ssl session
                    caching, etc, but that has nothing to do with maintaining
                    a userlist via dbm, which has to remain readable between
                    builds/machines, etc.  The use-multiple database schema
                    for apr-util would let us do this with just apr, though."
		Ian says:  "multi-dbm is in, but it still has ndbm support hardcoded
		            is this still required? isn't ndbm supported via gdbm?"


    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
	- case_preserved_filename stuff
	    (use the new canonical name stuff?)
	- find a new home for ap_text(_header)
	- is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * callers of ap_run_create_request() should check the return value
      for failure (Doug volunteers)

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
	(at least) needs to be done:
	- winnt MPM: Fix 95/98 code paths in the winnt MPM. There is some NT
	specific code that is still not in NT only code paths
	- IOL binds to APR sendfile, implemented with TransmitFile, which 
        is not available on 95/98.
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)  This could be resolved with an SSL library, or
        randomization in APR itself.
        - Bring the Win9xConHook.dll from 1.3 into 2.0 (no sense till it
        actually works) and add in a splash of Win9x service code.

    * In order to use a DSO version of mod_ssl we have to link with
      -lssl and -lcrypto. A workaround is in place right now where the
      entire EXTRA_LIBS macro is being appended to the objects list, but
      this is a hack. We should either revamp the APACHE_CHECK_SSL_TOOLKIT
      autoconf function or come up with some other autoconf checks to
      search for libssl and libcrypto and properly add them to mod_ssl's
      link flags.

    * Make the worker MPM the default MPM for threaded Unix boxes.
      +1:   Justin, Jeff, Ian
      -0:   Aaron (premature decision, needs more discussion), Lars
      -0:   Cliff (I think the default config should be the safest possible)

    * Fix the worker MPM to use POD to kill child processes instead
      of ap_os_killpg, regardless of how they should die. (Ryan Bloom)

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.
        OtherBill suggests: We at least seem to agree on eliminating
                            the <Container ~ foo> forms, and using only
                            <ContainerMatch foo> semantics.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

    * orig_ct in the byterange/multipart handling may not be
      needed. Apache 1.3 just never stashed "multipart" into
      r->content_type. We should probably follow suit since the
      byterange stuff doesn't want the rest of the code to see the
      multipart content-type; the other code should still think it is
      dealing with the <orig_ct> stuff.
        Status: Greg volunteers to investigate (esp. since he was most 
                likely the one to break it :-)

Other features that need writing:

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: post 2.0

    * TODO in source -- just do an egrep on "TODO" and see what's there

Available Patches:

   * Jon Travis's <jtravis@covalent.net> patch to deal with thread-safe
     issues with inet_ntoa.  See message <20001201163220.A12827@covalent.net>
	Status:  This is being set aside until the IPv6 work is finished
		 so that we know exactly what is required.

   * Martin Sojka <msojka@gmx.de>'s patch to add error reporting for failed 
     htpasswd actions due to a full /tmp volume (other programs may have
     similar problems?)
        PR: 6475
        Status:

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve
     performance
       Status: These were written for 1.3, and are awaiting a port to
       2.0
 
   * Jim Winstead's <jimw@trainedmonkey.com> patch to add CookieDomain and 
     other small mod_usertrack features

   * Dan Rench's <drench@xnet.com> patch to add allow the errmsg and timefmt 
     of SSI's to be modified in the config file.  Patch is available in 
     PR6193

Open issues:

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?
