RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * There is a bug in how we sort some hooks, at least the pre-config
      hook.  The first time we call the hooks, they are in the correct 
      order, but the second time, we don't sort them correctly.  Currently,
      the modules/http/config.m4 file has been renamed to 
      modules/http/config2.m4 to work around this problem, it should moved
      back when this is fixed.    rbb

    * The AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter directives do not allow the
      administrator to remove or reorder filters.  Once a filter is added
      in a container, it is present in any subcontainers.  It can only be
      added to the filter chain after any filters specified in enclosing
      containers.

    * mod_dir should normally redirect ALL directory requests which do
      not include a trailing slash on the URI. However, if a "notes"
      flag is set (say, via BrowserMatch), this behavior will be
      disabled for non-GET requests.
        Status: Greg volunteers
        MsgId: <20010227104646.E2297@lyra.org>
        MsgId: <3A9C0097.9C83F07C@Golux.Com>

    * mod_negotiation will not serve a request when an early extention
      is understood, but a later extention is not.  e.g. if the request
      index.html.bak is recieved, and negotition could find the file
      index.html.bak.en, it still won't be served because the 
      ap-mime-exception-list will contain "index" and "bak", and the
      string "index.bak" doesn't match "index.html.bak".  Need to
      review the ap-mime-exception-list component by component to be
      allow these cases.  [This could be part of a patch to allow the
      name index.bak in the case above to match index.html.bak.en]

    * mod_negotiation needs a new option or directive, something like
      ForceLanguagePriority, to fall back to the LanguagePriority
      directive instead of returning a "no acceptable variant" error.

    * Usability: Sanitize the MPM config directives.  MaxClients in 
      the threaded MPM is totally misleading now as it has little to
      do with limiting the number of clients (it limits the number
      of child processes). Bill proposed nomenclature change to
      something like "StartWorkers, MaxWorkers, etc." that could 
      apply to most all the MPMs (with some notable exceptions).
      Bill would be happy with changing MaxClients to MaxServers
      to make it agree with the operation of the StartServers
      directive.

    * configure --enable-mods-shared=most option has issues.  Example: 

      ./configure --enable-mods-shared=most

        This builds mod_headers as a DSO (good) but builds mod_mime
        as a compiled-in module (bad).

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * add mod_gz to httpd-2.0
      +1: Greg, Justin, Cliff
      -0: Doug, ben
       0: Jim (premature decision at present, IMO)
      -1: Ryan
      
      non-binding: Ian (+1)

    * daedalus: mod_cgid and suexec have a problem co-existing.  suexec 
      sees a null command string sometimes.  The problem happens when
      you access bugs.apache.org, then click on the "search the bug db"
      button.

    * Win32: Rotatelogs sometimes is not terminated when Apache
      goes down hard.  FirstBill was looking at possibly tracking the 
      child's-child processes in the parent process.

    * Win32: Add a simple hold console open patch (wait for close or
        the ESC key, with a nice message) if the server died a bad 
        death (non-zero exit code) in console mode.
        Resolution: bring forward same ugly hacks from 1.3.13-.20

    * Port of mod_ssl to Apache 2.0:

      The current porting state is summarized in modules/ssl/README.  The next
      step is to figure out how the old three configuration contexts (global,
      per-server, per-directory) can be ported to Apache 2.0 (especially the
      global context which has to survive server restarts RSE still does not
      know how to port). Then the remaining source files (which depend on the
      configuration contexts) which are still tagged with "-" in
      modules/ssl/README can be ported. 
      
      One more thing to figure out is how and when mod_ssl can provide the
      interactive pass phrase dialog (in Apache 1.3 it used the first init
      round [where tty was still not detached] and skipped the second init
      round [where it was already detached]). Apache 2.0 requires (or already
      has?) an official hook where such tty-dialogs can be performed.

      RSE is on holiday until June 11th, 2001. After this he starts
      working on mod_ssl again and tries to make mod_ssl running inside
      Apache 2.0 by end of June. If anyone wants to help making mod_ssl
      running in the meantime, feel free to make your hands dirty inside
      modules/ssl/. Do whatever you think is appropriate to get it
      running. I've no objections of any kind, except: just do not
      remove any old functionality. Keep everything, even if it needs
      #if 0...endif wrapped to not make trouble for you.

    * Performance: Get the SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
      optimization working in threaded.  prefork's new design for how
      to notice data on the pod should be sufficient.

    * mod_tls is very specific to OpenSSL. Make the API calls
      more generic to support other encryption libraries.

    * Performance & Debug: Eliminate most (and perhaps all) of the 
      malloc/free calls in the bucket brigade code.  Need some 
      light weight memory management functions that allow freeing 
      memory (putting it back into a memory pool) when it is no 
      longer needed. Enabling simple debugging features like guard
      bands, double free detection, etc. would be cool but certainly
      not a hard requirement.
        Status: Cliff, David, et al have discussed using the blocks SMS
	        for this.  First step is to s/malloc/apr_sms_malloc/g, etc.
		We could then have a thread-private SMS that is pointed
		to by the conn_rec's or something so that all calls to
		the bucket create functions can pass in that SMS.  No locks
		required.  Should be fast... 

    * Eliminate unnecessary creation of pipes in mod_cgid

    * the autoconf setup should be fixed to default to using the 
      "Apache" layout from config.layout, and each variable settable
      in a layout should be overridable on the command line.  Plus,
      what we do right now just doesn't seem to fully fit into how autoconf
      works, eg. AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT issues.
        Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.20.0104031557420.20876-100000@alive.znep.com>

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * Document mod_file_cache.

    * OS/2: Make mod_status work for spmt_os2 MPM.

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Architect start-up code that avoids initializing all the modules 
      in the parent process on platforms that do not support fork.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
        the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
        for predictable mod_auth_db/dbm administration.

    * use apu_dbm in mod_auth_dbm
        Status: Greg +1 (low-priority volunteer)
        Justin says: "Seems like this is already there, so should we just 
                      remove the other DBM code in that file?  If you want 
                      to use gdbm, or dbm, etc, you should tell apr-util."

    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
	- case_preserved_filename stuff
	    (use the new canonical name stuff?)
	- find a new home for ap_text(_header)
	- is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * APR-ize resolver stuff in mod_unique_id (Jeff volunteers)

    * callers of ap_run_create_request() should check the return value
      for failure (Doug volunteers)

    * when prefork bails out due to an initialization error in the detached
      process (e.g., mutex init failure), other children (cgid, at least) 
      are left hanging around

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
	(at least) needs to be done:
	- winnt MPM: Fix 95/98 code paths in the winnt MPM. There is some NT
	specific code that is still not in NT only code paths
	- IOL binds to APR sendfile, implemented with TransmitFile, which 
        is not available on 95/98.
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)  This could be resolved with an SSL library, or
        randomization in APR itself.
        - Bring the Win9xConHook.dll from 1.3 into 2.0 (no sense till it
        actually works) and add in a splash of Win9x service code.

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

    * orig_ct in the byterange/multipart handling may not be
      needed. Apache 1.3 just never stashed "multipart" into
      r->content_type. We should probably follow suit since the
      byterange stuff doesn't want the rest of the code to see the
      multipart content-type; the other code should still think it is
      dealing with the <orig_ct> stuff.

                likely the one to break it :-)
