CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mpm_winnt_waits.patch
        is easier to read (-U8)
      +1: mturk
      wrowe notes: a patch should have the necessary effect with the
        minimum lines of code - there's alot of redecorating that's
        going on in this patch to no net effect.  The WAIT_TIMEOUT
        result value seems to be ignored in the revised code?

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?
      wrowe asks: ditto jerenkrantz

    * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml?r1=420990&r2=421725 (docs)
      +1: niq, mturk
      -.9: wrowe notes; modifying the existing syntax seems inappropriate, new
           ProxyPassSubstitute or similarly named directives would seem to
           make more sense, permit direct Reverse'als when appropriate and
           restrict the Substitutions to be parsed only when required.

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.
     wrowe: ditto's - good concept.

   * core: Allow AcceptMutex to accept pathname arguments ala SSLMutex,
     and, as a result, semi-depreciate Lockfile.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=467326
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=468049
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works (requires handling of CHANGES and ap_mmn.h
       conflict though)
     +1: jim, wrowe
     wrowe notes: Adding to ease migration to 2.4 - good.  Deprecating 
                  any directive in a .even released branch, bad.
     jim notes: it's more an enhancement to AcceptMutex than a
                depreciation of LockFile... no regressions are
                introduced.
     wrowe adds: Isn't it time for SSL/FTP/JK/FTP who all need the very
                 same syntax to benefit from one generic implementation
                 (in httpd, not apr, since it's config syntax specific).

   * mod_proxy_balancer: Remove unnecessary lock/unlock for
     the post_request hook. We are actually doing nothing here.
     But keep the code (but macroed out) for future usage.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484789
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484794
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works.
     +1: jim
     +0: rpluem: Shouldn't we remove this code on 2.2.x? Keeping seems to be ok
         for me on trunk, but on a stable branch?
         jim says: the reason why we keep it is in case we
         ever start using it. So we keep the framework in
         that case. Make trunk backports easier.

   * mod_cache: Correctly cache objects whose URL query string has been
     modified by mod_rewrite.
        PR: 40805
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=476625
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works
     +1: rpluem

   * mod_cache: While serving a cached entity ensure that filters that have
     been applied to this cached entity before saving it to the cache are not
     applied again.

       PR: 35314
