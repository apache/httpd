CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Various modules: Add explicit charset to the output of various modules to
     work around possible cross-site scripting flaws affecting web browsers that
     do not derive the response character set as required by RFC2616.

      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/utf7_fix_2.2.x.diff
      +1: rpluem, wrowe
      wrowe notes; as nice as customization might be, this mirrors the behavior
      or all RFC conformant browsers, and additional customization can come
      as a new feature in the future.
      -1: niq.  We cannot label FTP directory listings as ISO-8859-1 unless
                we ensure they really are (e.g. some backend platforms will
                give us UTF-8).  Also mod_dav embeds r->uri in the response:
                we would need to URL-escape that before HTML-escaping it
                to ensure that it's ISO-8859-1-compatible.
      rpluem says: Please see my answers on list. Keep in mind that we do NOT
                   create a regression by this patch but only enforce browsers
                   who do not act in an RFC compliant manner to do so.
                   So please reconsider your -1.
      wrowe echos rpluem's sentiments, and argues supporting non-RFC clients
            is not a key purpose of httpd.  However, if the associated non
            showstopper new-feature will satisfy you, perhaps this should
            be adopted (c.f. mod_proxy_ftp below).
      niq says: I withdraw my -1 if we also apply a patch that enables
                an admin to specify charset in an FTP directory list.

   * mod_proxy_balancer: Correctly escape the worker route and the worker
     redirect string in the HTML output of the balancer manager.

   * mod_dav_fs: Adjust etag generation to produce identical results on 32-bit
     and 64-bit platforms. Avoid a regression with conditional PUT's on lock
     and etag (because we have a regression otherwise this is a showstopper).

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
     (revised proposal dealing with wrowe's concerns).
     trunk:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)

     2.2.x:
       http://people.apache.org/~niq/proxy-interp.patch
     rpluem says: Please add the documentation to your 2.2.x version of your
                  patch and a minor bump (changes to public mod_proxy.h) and
                  assume you are +1 to your own proposal.
     niq says: I'll attend to that.  As regards vote, I'm +1 on the proposal,
               but -0 on including this as a new feature in 2.2.7.
               Better IMHO to separate releasing it from the many bugfixes
               in 2.2.7 mod_proxy.  Hence +1 for 2.2.8.

   * configure / install: Make https port configurable.

      +1: fuankg, wrowe
      wrowe notes; Win32 is already ready for this.

   * mod_ssl: Add server name indication (RFC 4366) support (PR 34607).
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=606190
      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         http://people.apache.org/~fuankg/diffs/httpd-2.2.x-sni.diff
      +1: fuankg
      +0: like ssl upgrade of 2.2, perhaps this is a good reason to bring
          httpd-2.4 to completion?  vhost changes could be disruptive to
          third party module authors.
      -1: rpluem: jorton found some problems with the trunk version and they
                  should be fixed / discussed in trunk before we backport.

   * mod_deflate: Don't leave a strong ETag in place when transforming content

    which list their contents in other-than ISO-8859-1 charset (e.g. utf-8).

               delivers the functionality needed for the charset "showstopper".

   *) mod_ldap: Try to establish a new backend LDAP connection when the
      Microsoft LDAP client library returns LDAP_UNAVAILABLE, e.g. after the
      LDAP server has closed the connection due to a timeout.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
