CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

* We should wait for a release of APR 1.3.4 at least for

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    +1: pgollucci, pquerna
    -0: covener: Don't We get a pass on some of these issues for building 
                 without UTF-8 support and/or not having ever moved past 5.x?
                 It's not always crisp from the advisories. I'd hate to jump 
                 up to 7.8 and pick up unknown exposures from an expanding
                 codebase.
        pquerna says: We can't protect ourselves from our dependencies by _not_ 
            upgrading -- the best policy IMO is to follow them, 5.x is not going
            to be maintained.
    +0
    -1: niq: since pcre just got deleted from trunk, this isn't even
             a backport being proposed.  It's an untested change over
             their major versions, when we promise binary-compatibility!
             If we're in the business of untested changes, then make
             the sane one and just stop bundling it altogether.
    -1: rpluem: Agree with niq on binary compatibility argument. But IMHO
                unbundling it is also not possible with 2.2.x for the
                same reason. IMHO this has to wait until 2.4.
    -1: sctemme: This is one of the perils of bundling, but IMHO for 2.2.x
                 we're stuck with it.  And if that starts inheriting us 
                 security issues that we can't fix, all the more reason 
                 to retire the branch.

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
