Apache 2.0 STATUS:

Release:

    2.0: In pre-alpha development

Plan:

    * Vague goal of an alpha or beta release in 1999. Commit-then-review
      is active.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * suEXEC doesn't work

    * Windows NT port isn't done
        Status: Bill is working on this through his MPM work, and Ryan
        is with APR.

    * Current 2.0 code is not tested on many Unix platforms. Make 2.0
      work on most, if not all the systems 1.3 did

        Status: Autoconf and APR will get us most of the way there.

    * The module API is a weird combination of the old table and the new
      hook system. Switch completely to the new hook system
        Status: Ben Laurie is working on this.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Switch to autoconf, et al. for configuration.

    * Use APR to get rid of more platform dependancies.
        Status: Ryan Bloom <rbb@raleigh.ibm.com> is working on this.

    * The connection status table is not very efficient. Also, very few stats
      are exported to the connection status table (easy to fix), and mod_status
      is ugly.

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

    * Areas where APRFile is being used need to be cleaned-up

    * SIGSEGV on Linux seems to only kill a thread not a whole process;
      we need to work around this, probably by bouncing the signal to
      the sigwait thread. But this will hurt debugability.

Other features that need writing:

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: ?

    * TODO in source -- just do an egrep on "TODO" and see what's there

    * Odd comments in source (egrep for "ZZZ") need to be cleaned-up

    * Work on other MPMs. Possible MPMs discussed or in progress include:

      - Dean Gaudet's async MPM
          Status: ?

      - Zach Brown's <zab@zabbo.net> Linux siginfo MPM
          Status: ?

Documentation that needs writing:

    * The concept of MPMs, especially if we ship more than one MPM for a
      given platform

    * New directives in the various MPMs

    * API documentation
        Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
        (apache-2.0/htdocs/hooks.html)

    * Changes since 1.3.9 can be more easily seen in the commitlog file
         dev.apache.org:/home/cvs/CVSROOT/commitlogs/apache-2.0
      which includes some of Roy's comments when the changes were
      committed in rough change-sets by purpose.  Note that the commitlog
      does not show the contents of new files until later.

Available Patches:

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve
     performance
       Status: These were written for 1.3, and are awaiting a port to
       2.0

Open issues:

   * What do we do about mod_proxy?

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?

   * Is conf/highperformance.conf-dist obsolete?  It looks obsolete.
