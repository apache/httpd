Apache 2.0 STATUS:
Last modified at [$Date: 2000/04/14 23:36:12 $]

Release:

    2.0a3   : vague plans to release in April sometime.
    2.0a2   : released March 31, 2000
    2.0a1   : released March 10, 2000

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:
    * Re-work configuration for top level Apache.  Work should start with
      trying to clean the autoconf stuff.  If and only if this proves
      impossible to do (very unlikely), autoconf should be removed and we
      will roll our own config implementation.
      NOTE: When this is implemented, it would be really nice if the
            default cgi module on Unix with a threaded MPM is the cgid
            module.  This should be override-able of course.
          Status: Jim Jagielski is looking into this.

    * Fix SAFEREAD.
	see <Pine.LNX.4.21.0004101511380.7822-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * MPMs should have responsibility for closing sockets and
        registering the socket cleanup. Stop registering multiple
        cleanups for each socket. Move socket close code out of
        http_connection.c and into the MPMs.
	Status:

    * Reliable piped logs look broken everywhere. Each MPM includes essentially
	identical code to ap_register_other_child(), etc. Most of this code can
	be moved out of the MPMs and into some common file (http_core.c?).
	Dean says presumably you mean an os-specific file?

    * Pipes to CGI scripts are not being timed out
        Status: code has been added to APR to support timing out pipes.
                This needs to be used in Apache now.

    * Put back resource limit code

    * suEXEC doesn't work
        Status: Manoj has posted an patch to fix this.
        <19991103003605.A20612@samosa.mindspring.com>

    * Win32: Enable the Windows MPM to honor max_requests_per_child
        Status: Bill will fix this.

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
	(at least) needs to be done:
	- winnt MPM: Fix 95/98 code paths in the winnt MPM. There is some NT
	specific code that is still not in NT only code paths
	- APR sendfile uses TransmitFile which is not available on
	95/98.
	- ap_stat uses GetFileAttributeEx which is not available on
	95/98

	Status:

    * Win32: Test access logging with multiple threads. Will the 
	native file I/O calls serialize automagically like the 
	CRT calls or do we need to add region locking each time 
	we access the logs?
	Status: 

    * Win32:  Smoke test all ported modules to make sure they work 
	correctly under Windows.
	Status: 

    * Current 2.0 code is not tested on many Unix platforms. Make 2.0
      work on most, if not all the systems 1.3 did
        Status: Autoconf and APR will get us most of the way there.

    * The handler hook needs to use the new registration system

    * Modules.  Which modules do not work yet, can we get a list?

    * We need a thread-safe resolver, at least on Unix.
        Status: The best known candidate would be something from
	BIND v9.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:
    * Configuration Modules.  Allow a new module type that reads 
      a config file and sets up an internal tree structure for
      configuration.
    
    * "make distclean" leaves (at least these) turds:
	lib/.deps
	lib/apr/.deps
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/config.log
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/mm_conf.h
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/libtool
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/config.status
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/Makefile
	lib/apr/shmem/unix/mm/mm-config
	main/a
	modules/.deps
	modules/mpm/.deps
	os/.deps

    * the top-level configure.in appears to use $USE_MAINTAINER_MODE = yes
	to set -Wall/etc. flags, and the APR configure.in appears to use
	--with-debug.  both seem like more of a hardwired pain compaired
	to the pre-2.0 method of setting EXTRA_CFLAGS.

    * Win32: Reuse accept socket after transmitfile/close
	This is not a bug, but would be nice to get this feature in 
	before ship.

    * Win32: Enable the winnt MPM to use the new scoreboard API

    * Win32: Non-blocking CGI pipes

    * Win32: Graceful restart of a service is broken (code does shutdown then start)

    * Dynamically loadable MPMs
      Enable users of the binary distributions of Apache to be able to 
      dynamically load the MPM.

      Dean says this probably isn't a good idea.  For example consider
      -lpthread, you couldn't have the same core run with pthreads,
      prefork, and gnu pth without a lot of headaches is my guess.

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Consider introducing HAVE_FORK feature macro. Architect start-up code
      that avoids initializing all the modules in the parent process on
      platforms that do not support fork.

    * Clean the code.  There are a lot of places we used APR but didn't 
      remove the hacks that were required for the cross-platform code in
      1.3.  We need to make the code look like APR was supposed to be there. 

    * Go throught the 1.3 Bug DB and research the bugs marked "suspended".
      People were told these would be considered for inclusion in Apache 2.0,
      it would be nice to actually do so.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

      Bill says we need a new procattr, APR_CREATE_SUSPENDED (or
      something similar) to direct ap_create_process to create the
      process suspended. We also need a call to wake up the suspended 
      process This may not be able to be implemented everywhere though.

        Status: 

    * Move I/O layering into APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      loosing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Win32: Implement reliable piped logs on Windows
        Status: 

    * Switch to autoconf, et al. for configuration.
        Status: Manoj has placed an initial version into the 2.0
        repository. Todos include:
          
          - "make install" should work
          - a tool to simplfy third-party module building should be
            written. Something like apxs
          - Add a lot more checks to satisfy the various platforms, e.g.
            for threading

    * Use APR to get rid of more platform dependancies.
        Status: Ryan Bloom <rbb@covalenet.net> is working on this.

    * The connection status table is not very efficient. Also, very few stats
      are exported to the connection status table (easy to fix), and mod_status
      is ugly.

    * Optimise the name-based <VirtualHost> implementation so that it uses
      a hash table instead of a linear linked list scan.

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

Other features that need writing:

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: post 2.0

    * TODO in source -- just do an egrep on "TODO" and see what's there

Documentation that needs writing:
    * Mod_status docs are needed.

    * The concept of MPMs, especially if we ship more than one MPM for a
      given platform

    * New directives in the various MPMs and appropriate links from
	obsolete directives in core.html to the MPM documentation.

    * Revise manual/stopping.html and the last part of
	manual/misc/perf-tuning.html to take account of the MPMs.

    * API documentation
        Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
        (apache-2.0/htdocs/hooks.html)

    * Changes since 1.3.9 can be more easily seen in the commitlog file
         dev.apache.org:/home/cvs/CVSROOT/commitlogs/apache-2.0
      which includes some of Roy's comments when the changes were
      committed in rough change-sets by purpose.  Note that the commitlog
      does not show the contents of new files until later.

Available Patches:
   * Brian Martin's patch to get mod_auth_digest working
     <20000413170306.B23887@joe.penguincomputing.com> 04/14/2000

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve
     performance
       Status: These were written for 1.3, and are awaiting a port to
       2.0

Open issues:

   * What do we do about mod_proxy?

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?

   * Is conf/highperformance.conf-dist obsolete?  It looks obsolete.
