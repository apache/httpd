This document outlines the steps needed to install Apache onto a TPF system.
<br><br>
You should first read htdocs/manual/<a href="readme-tpf.html">readme-tpf.html</a>
for basic information on the port of Apache to TPF including required PUT level
and supported functions &amp; modules.
</p>

<a name="setup">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 align=center>Setup</h2>
<p>
Due to the use of EBCDIC on MVS OS/390 Open Edition (later referred to simply as
"Open Edition"), we've found that the most reliable
method for loading Apache onto your system is to unzip and tar the distribution
file on your PC, and then copy the extracted files to Open Edition via an NFS client
capable of transferring the data in EBCDIC format.
<br><br>
Before moving the distribution to an
Open Edition environment, verify that the NFS drive will transfer the
filenames with upper/lower case preserved.
<br><br>
Since Open Edition is not the ultimate destination of the files,
the only required files and subdirectories that need to be moved to Open Edition
are in /src.
<br><br>
<font strong color=red>WARNING</font>:
If you are using a product such as WinZip on your PC, verify that
the <i>"TAR File Smart CR/LF Conversion"</i> option is NOT checked.
You can find this in WinZip under Options, Configuration.
Since you had to tar and unzip the file to read this document,
you need to re-tar and -unzip if the CR/LF option was checked.
This will save you lots of headaches later on.
<br><br>
<font strong color=red>WARNING</font>:
Editing files on a PC before moving them to Open Edition may result
in the loss/addition of unprintable characters.  Files of concern include shell
scripts and src/Configuration.  The most common problems are with tab characters
and CR/LF characters.  Most editors will handle the CR/LF problem correctly
but none seem to handle tab characters.  If you need to edit files, edit them
in a UNIX editor such as vi or emacs.
</p>

<a name="compilation">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 align=center>Compilation</h2>
<p>
Apache supports the notion of "optional modules".  However,
the server has to know which modules are compiled into it.  In order for
those modules to be effective, it is necessary to generate a short bit of
code ("modules.c") which simply has a list of them. If you are using the
make and Configure utility, "modules.c" will be created for you.
<br><br>
The provided scripts assume a c89 compiler and have only been tested on an
Open Edition environment.  If you are using a platform other that
Open Edition you may need to modify src/os/tpf/TPFExport and src/Configure
to match your environment.
<br><br>
Note that UNIX/Open Edition commands in this section are shown in
<tt><strong>bold</strong></tt>,
are case sensitive, and must be made from the "src" directory.
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Overlay src/Configuration with src/Configuration.tmpl:  
    <tt><strong>cp&nbsp;Configuration.tmpl&nbsp;Configuration</strong></tt>
    <br><br>
<li>Edit src/Configuration.  It contains the list and settings
    of various "Rules" and an additional section at the bottom that determines
    which modules to compile:
    <br><br>
    <ol type=a>
    <li>Adjust the Rules and <tt>EXTRA_CFLAGS|LIBS|LDFLAGS|INCLUDES</tt>
        if you feel so inclined.
    <br><br>
    <li>Comment out (by preceding the line with a "#") lines corresponding
        to those modules you DO&nbsp;NOT wish to include.
        At present the following modules MUST be commented out
        as they are not yet supported on TPF: mod_actions, mod_auth,
        mod_cgi, mod_env, mod_include, & mod_status.
    <br><br>
    <li>Uncomment (by removing the initial "#", if present) lines
        corresponding to those optional modules you wish
        to include or add new lines corresponding to any custom modules
        you have written.
        The htdocs/manual/<a href="readme-tpf.html">readme-tpf.html</a>
        document lists the modules that have been tested on TPF.
    </ol>
    <br>
<li>Overlay src/Makefile.tmpl with src/Makefile.tpf:
    <tt><strong>cp&nbsp;Makefile.tpf&nbsp;Makefile.tmpl</strong></tt>
    <br><br>
<li>Overlay src/main/Makefile.tmpl with src/main/Makefile.tpf:
    <tt><strong>cp&nbsp;main/Makefile.tpf&nbsp;main/Makefile.tmpl</strong></tt>
    <br><br>
<li>Set the TPF environment variables:
    <tt><strong>.&nbsp;os/tpf/TPFExport</strong></tt>
    <br>
    (The initial period and blank on the command are required to ensure
    the environment variables exist beyond the scope of the shell script.)
    This script will set the environment variables required to compile the
    programs for TPF.  Verify that the export variables are valid for your
    installation, in particular, the system include file directories.  The
    system include files must reside on your Open Edition system in the
    appropriate file structure similar to /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.
    DO&nbsp;NOT modify the <tt>TPF=YES</tt> export variable.  If this is changed, the
    "Configure" script will not recognize TPF.
    <br><br>
<li>Run the "Configure" script:
    <tt><strong>Configure</strong></tt>
    <br>
    The output will look something like this...
      <pre>
      Using config file: Configuration
      Creating Makefile
       + configured for TPF platform
       + setting C compiler to c89
       + setting C pre-processor to c89 -E
       + checking for system header files
       + adding selected modules
      Creating Makefile in support
      Creating Makefile in main
      Creating Makefile in ap
      Creating Makefile in regex
      Creating Makefile in os/tpf
      Creating Makefile in modules/standard
      Creating Makefile in modules/example
      $ _
      </pre>
    This generates modules.c and new versions of the Makefiles.
    <br><br>
    If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you can say, e.g.,
    <br>
    <tt><strong>Configure -file Configuration.ai</strong></tt>
    <br>
      <pre>
      Using config file: Configuration.ai
      Creating Makefile
       + configured for &lt;whatever&gt; platform
       + setting C compiler to &lt;whatever&gt;
      et cetera
      </pre>

    If you receive an error such as "<tt>Configure 146: FSUM7351 not found</tt>"
    the most likely explanation is that one or more of the make related
    files were edited on a non-UNIX platform, corrupting the end-of-line marks.
    Verify that lines ending with "\" in the flagged file do&nbsp;not have trailing
    spaces.  Using the vi editor and the sample error above as an example...
    <br><br><pre>
            pull up the flagged file:       <strong>vi&nbsp;Configure</strong>
            turn on punctuation:            <strong>:set&nbsp;list</strong>
            go to the line in question:     <strong>146G</strong>
               or find a line with a "\":   <strong>/\\</strong></pre>
    The end of line should display as "<tt>\$</tt>".  If it is displayed as
    "<tt>\ $</tt>" (with a blank between \ and $) then you should revert to the
    distributed version of the file and make the site-specific
    changes again using a UNIX compatible editor such as vi or emacs.
    Then try the Configure command again.
    <br><pre>            close the file:                 <strong>:q  </strong>(or 

<strong>:quit!</strong>)</pre>
<li>Now compile the programs: <tt><strong>make</strong></tt><br>
    The modules placed in the Apache distribution are the ones that have been
    tested and are used regularly by various members of the Apache development
    group.  Additional modules contributed by members or third parties with specific
    needs or functions are available at
    <a 

href="http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/">http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/</a

>.
    There are instructions on that page for linking these modules into the core Apache
    code.
    <br><br>
    If during compilation you get a warning about a missing 'regex.h', set
    <tt>WANTHSREGEX=yes</tt> in the src/Configuration file and start back at the
    <tt><strong>Configure</strong></tt> step.
</ol>
</p>

<a name="installation">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 align=center>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>After compilation, you will have all the object files required to build an
  "httpd" loadset.  The next step is to link the object files and create a loadset to be
  stored in a PDS.  Sample JCL for linking and loadsets has been included in
  src/os/tpf/samples as "linkdll.jcl" and "loadset.jcl".  You can submit these jobs
  from CMS or directly from Open Edition if you have the proper authority.  After
  the jobs have completed, you can <tt>ZOLDR LOAD</tt> them to your TPF system.
  <br><br>
  NOTE: The <tt>mod_<i>xxx</i>.o</tt> files in the linkdll.jcl file must correspond to the
  <tt>mod_<i>xxx</i>.o</tt> lines in the src/Configuration file.
  <br><br>
<li>
  Apache requires a configuration file to initialize itself during activation.
  (Previously three configuration files were used.)
  Copy the distribution version, /conf/httpd.conf-dist, to /conf/httpd.conf and then
  edit the /conf/httpd.conf copy with your site specific information.  This first release
  of Apache for TPF only runs under the "inetd" model so you
  <font strong color=red>must</font> change <tt>ServerType</tt> from <tt>standalone</tt>
  to <tt>inetd</tt>.
  <br><br>
  General documentation for Apache is located at
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/">http://www.apache.org/docs/</a>
  and in the HTML pages included with this distribution under the
  /htdocs/manual directory.
  <br><br>
<li>On TPF activate ZCLAW and update INETD using ZINET entries, the common case:
    <br><br>
    <pre>
    ZINET ADD S-TFTP   PGM-CTFT PORT-69 PROTOCOL-UDP MODEL-NOWAIT
    ZINET ADD S-APACHE PGM-<i>pppp</i> PORT-80 PROTOCOL-TCP MODEL-NOWAIT</pre>
  Please refer to <i>IBM Transaction Processing Facility Transmission Control
  Protocol/Internet Protocol Version 4 Release 1</i> for more information
  on ZCLAW, INETD, and TFTP.
  <br><br>
<li>Prior to sending a request to your Apache server from a browser,
    TFTP the configuration file, log, icons and web pages to your TPF system.
    A typical directory structure for Apache is as follows:
<pre>     /usr/local/apache/conf
     /usr/local/apache/logs
     /usr/local/apache/icons
     /usr/local/apache/htdocs</pre>
    The logs directory must exist in order to avoid an
    <code>fopen</code> error while running Apache.  TFTP an empty file into
    the logs subdirectory to create it.  All gif, jpg, and zip files should be
    TFTP'd as binary; conf files and html pages should be TFTP'd as text.
</ol>
<a name="visualage">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 align=center>Compiling with VisualAge TPF</h2>
<p>
  It is not required that "make" be used to compile Apache for TPF:
  Individual programs may be compiled using IBM's VisualAge TPF product.
  This is particularly useful when compiling selected programs for the Debug Tool.
  <br><br>
  The following VisualAge compile settings are required:
  <ul>
  <li><i>"DEFINE - Define preprocessor macro name(s)"</i> must include
     <tt><strong>TPF, CHARSET_EBCDIC, _POSIX_SOURCE,</strong></tt> and
     <tt><strong>USE_HSREGEX</strong></tt>
  <br><br>
  <li><i>"LSEARCH - Path for user include files"</i> must include
     <tt><strong>../src/include</strong></tt> and <tt><strong>../src/os/tpf</strong></tt>
  <br><br>
  <li><i>"DLL - Generate DLL code"</i> must be checked
  <br><br>
  <li><i>"LONGNAME - Support long names"</i> must be checked
  </ul>
