<H2>Running a High-Performance Web Server for BSD</H2>

Like other OS's, the listen queue is often the <b>first limit hit</b>.  The
following are comments from "Aaron Gifford &lt;agifford@InfoWest.COM&gt;"
on how to fix this on BSDI 1.x, 2.x,  and FreeBSD 2.0 (and earlier):

<p>

Edit the following two files:
<blockquote><code>  /usr/include/sys/socket.h <br>
  /usr/src/sys/sys/socket.h </code></blockquote>
In each file, look for the following:
<pre>
    /*
     * Maximum queue length specifiable by listen.
     */
    #define SOMAXCONN       5
</pre>

Just change the "5" to whatever appears to work.  I bumped the two
machines I was having problems with up to 32 and haven't noticed the
problem since.

<p>

After the edit, recompile the kernel and recompile the Apache server
then reboot.  

<P>

FreeBSD 2.1 seems to be perfectly happy, with SOMAXCONN
set to 32 already.

<A NAME="detail">
<b>Addendum for <i>very</i> heavily loaded BSD servers</b><br>
</A>
from Chuck Murcko &lt;chuck@telebase.com&gt;

<p>

If you're running a really busy BSD Apache server, the following are useful
things to do if the system is acting sluggish:<p>

<ul>

<li> Run vmstat to check memory usage, page/swap rates, etc.

<li> Run netstat -m to check mbuf usage

<li> Run fstat to check file descriptor usage

</ul>

These utilities give you an idea what you'll need to tune in your kernel,
and whether it'll help to buy more RAM.

Here are some BSD kernel config parameters (actually BSDI, but pertinent to
FreeBSD and other 4.4-lite derivatives) from a system getting heavy usage.
The tools mentioned above were used, and the system memory was increased to
48 MB before these tuneups. Other system parameters remained unchanged.

<p>

<pre>
maxusers        256
</pre>

Maxusers drives a <i>lot</i> of other kernel parameters:

<ul>

<li> Maximum # of processes

<li> Maximum # of processes per user

<li> System wide open files limit

<li> Per-process open files limit

<li> Maximum # of mbuf clusters

<li> Proc/pgrp hash table size

</ul>

The actual formulae for these derived parameters are in
<i>/usr/src/sys/conf/param.c</i>.
These calculated parameters can also be overridden (in part) by specifying
your own values in the kernel configuration file:

<pre>
# Network options. NMBCLUSTERS defines the number of mbuf clusters and
# defaults to 256. This machine is a server that handles lots of traffic,
# so we crank that value.
options         SOMAXCONN=256           # max pending connects
options         NMBCLUSTERS=4096        # mbuf clusters at 4096

#
# Misc. options
#
options         CHILD_MAX=512           # maximum number of child processes
options         OPEN_MAX=512            # maximum fds (breaks RPC svcs)
</pre>

SOMAXCONN is not derived from maxusers, so you'll always need to increase
that yourself. We used a value guaranteed to be larger than Apache's
default for the listen() of 128, currently.

<p>

In many cases, NMBCLUSTERS must be set much larger than would appear
necessary at first glance. The reason for this is that if the browser
disconnects in mid-transfer, the socket fd associated with that particular
connection ends up in the TIME_WAIT state for several minutes, during
which time its mbufs are not yet freed.

<p>

Some more info on mbuf clusters (from sys/mbuf.h):
<pre>
/*
 * Mbufs are of a single size, MSIZE (machine/machparam.h), which
 * includes overhead.  An mbuf may add a single "mbuf cluster" of size
 * MCLBYTES (also in machine/machparam.h), which has no additional overhead
 * and is used instead of the internal data area; this is done when
 * at least MINCLSIZE of data must be stored.
 */
</pre>

<p>

CHILD_MAX and OPEN_MAX are set to allow up to 512 child processes (different
than the maximum value for processes per user ID) and file descriptors.
These values may change for your particular configuration (a higher OPEN_MAX
value if you've got modules or CGI scripts opening lots of connections or
files). If you've got a lot of other activity besides httpd on the same
machine, you'll have to set NPROC higher still. In this example, the NPROC
value derived from maxusers proved sufficient for our load.

<p>

<b>Caveats</b>

<p>

Be aware that your system may not boot with a kernel that is configured
to use more resources than you have available system RAM. <b>ALWAYS</b>
have a known bootable kernel available when tuning your system this way,
and use the system tools beforehand to learn if you need to buy more 
memory before tuning.

<p>

RPC services will fail when the value of OPEN_MAX is larger than 256.
This is a function of the original implementations of the RPC library,
which used a byte value for holding file descriptors. BSDI has partially
addressed this limit in its 2.1 release, but a real fix may well await
the redesign of RPC itself.

<p>

Finally, there's the hard limit of child processes configured in Apache.

<p>

For versions of Apache later than 1.0.5 you'll need to change the
definition for <b>HARD_SERVER_LIMIT</b> in <i>httpd.h</i> and recompile
if you need to run more than the default 150 instances of httpd.

<p>

From conf/httpd.conf-dist:

<pre>
# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
# reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# Unix with it as it spirals down...

MaxClients 150
</pre>

Know what you're doing if you bump this value up, and make sure you've
done your system monitoring, RAM expansion, and kernel tuning beforehand.
Then you're ready to service some serious hits!
