Apache httpd license
 ====================


This is the license for the Apache Server. It covers all the
files which come in this distribution, and should never be removed.

The "Apache Group" has based this server, called "Apache", on
public domain code distributed under the name "NCSA httpd 1.3".

NCSA httpd 1.3 was placed in the public domain by the National Center 
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign.

As requested by NCSA we acknowledge,

  "Portions developed at the National Center for Supercomputing
   Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."

Copyright on the sections of code added by the "Apache Group" belong
to the "Apache Group" and/or the original authors. The "Apache Group" and
authors hereby grant permission for their code, along with the
public domain NCSA code, to be distributed under the "Apache" name.

Reuse of "Apache Group" code outside of the Apache distribution should
be acknowledged with the following quoted text, to be included with any new
work;

 "Portions developed by the "Apache Group", taken with permission 
    from the Apache Server   http://www.hyperreal.com/apache/   "


Permission is hereby granted to anyone to redistribute Apache under
the "Apache" name. We do not grant permission for the resale of Apache, but
we do grant permission for vendors to bundle Apache free with other software,
or to charge a reasonable price for redistribution, provided it is made
clear that Apache is free. Permission is also granted for vendors to 
sell support for for Apache. We explicitly forbid the redistribution of 
Apache under any other name.

The "Apache Group" makes no promises to support "Apache". Users and
sellers of Apache support, and users of "Apache Group" code, should be 
aware that they use "Apache" or portions of the "Apache Group" code at 
their own risk. While every effort has been made to ensure that "Apache"
is robust and safe to use, we will not accept responsibility for any
damage caused, or loss of data or income which results from its use.
