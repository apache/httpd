.TP
\fIlog-id\fR
This is the id of the log, which is the SHA-256 hash of the log's public key, provided in hexadecimal format\&. This string is 64 characters in length\&.  
.TP
\fIrecord-id\fR
This is the record number in the database, as displayed by the \fBdump\fR sub-command, prefixed with \fB#\fR\&. As an example, \fB#4\fR references the fourth record in the database\&. (Use shell escaping as necessary\&.)  
.TP
\fI/path/to/public-key\&.pem\fR
This is a file containing the log's public key in PEM format\&. The public key is not stored in the database\&. Instead, a reference to the file is stored\&. Thus, the file cannot be removed until the public key in the database is removed or changed\&.  
.TP
\fImin-timestamp\fR, \fImax-timestamp\fR
A timestamp is a time as expressed in the number of milliseconds since the epoch, ignoring leap seconds\&. This is the form of time used in Signed Certificate Timestamps\&. This must be provided as a decimal number\&. Specify \fB\fB-\fR\fR for one of the timestamps if it is unknown\&. For example, when configuring the minimum valid timestamp for a log which remains valid, specify \fB\fB-\fR\fR for \fImax-timestamp\fR\&. SCTs received from this log by the proxy are invalid if the timestamp is older than \fImin-timestamp\fR or newer than \fImax-timestamp\fR\&.  
 

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
\fBctlogconfig\fR is a tool for creating and maintaining a log configuration database, for use with mod_ssl_ct\&.
 
.PP
Refer first to Log configuration in the mod_ssl_ct documentation\&.
 
.PP
Refer to the examples below for typical use\&.
 

.SH "SUB-COMMANDS"
  
 
.TP
dump
Display configuration database contents\&. The record id shown in the output of this sub-command can be used to identify the affected record in other sub-commands\&.  
.TP
configure-public-key
Add a log's public key to the database or set the public key for an existing entry\&. The log's public key is needed to validate the signature of SCTs received by a proxy from a backend server\&. (The database will be created if it does not yet exist\&.)  
.TP
configure-url
Add a log's URL to the database or set the URL for an existing entry\&. The log's URL is used when submitting server certificates to logs in order to obtain SCTs to send to clients\&. (The database will be created if it does not yet exist\&.)  
.TP
valid-time-range
Set the minimum valid time and/or the maximum valid time for a log\&. SCTs from the log with timestamps outside of the valid range will not be accepted\&. Use \fB-\fR for a time that is not being configured\&. (The database will be created if it does not yet exist\&.)  
.TP
trust
Mark a log as trusted, which is the default setting\&. This sub-command is used to reverse a \fIdistrust\fR setting\&. (The database will be created if it does not yet exist\&.)  
.TP
distrust
Mark a log as distrusted\&. (The database will be created if it does not yet exist\&.)  
.TP
forget
Remove information about a log from the database\&.  
 
.SH "EXAMPLES"
  
.PP
Consider an Apache httpd instance which serves as a TLS server and a proxy\&. The TLS server needs to obtain SCTs from a couple of known logs in order to pass those to clients, and the proxy needs to be able to validate the signature of SCTs received from backend servers\&.
 
.PP
First we'll configure the URLs for logs where server certificates are logged:
 
.nf

    $ ctlogconfig /path/to/conf/log-config configure-url https://log1\&.example\&.com/
    $ ctlogconfig /path/to/conf/log-config configure-url https://log2\&.example\&.com/
    $ ctlogconfig /path/to/conf/log-config dump
    Log entry:
      Record 1
      Log id         : (not configured)
      Public key file: (not configured)
      URL            : https://log1\&.example\&.com/
      Time range     : -INF to +INF 
    Log entry:
      Record 2
      Log id         : (not configured)
      Public key file: (not configured)
      URL            : https://log2\&.example\&.com/
      Time range     : -INF to +INF 
.fi
 
.PP
Next we'll set the public key of a log where the certificate of our only backend server is published\&. In this case it is the log with URL https://log2\&.example\&.com/ which has already been configured\&.
 
.nf

    $ ctlogconfig /path/to/conf/log-config configure-public-key \\
    $ ctlogconfig /path/to/conf/log-config dump
    Log entry:
      Record 1
      Log id         : (not configured)
      Public key file: (not configured)
      URL            : https://log1\&.example\&.com/
      Time range     : -INF to +INF 
    Log entry:
      Record 2
      Log id         : (not configured)
      Public key file: /path/to/conf/log2-pub\&.pem
      URL            : https://log2\&.example\&.com/
      Time range     : -INF to +INF 
.fi
