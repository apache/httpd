.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
\fBsuexec\fR -\fBV\fR


.SH "SUMMARY"

.PP
suexec is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before executing CGI programs\&. In order to achieve this, it must run as root\&. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as root, the suexec executable needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by root\&. It should never be writable for any other person than root\&.

.PP
For further information about the concepts and and the security model of suexec please refer to the suexec documentation (http://httpd\&.apache\&.org/docs-2\&.1/suexec\&.html)\&.


.SH "OPTIONS"

.RS

.TP
-V
If you are root, this option displays the compile options of suexec\&. For security reasons all configuration options are changable only at compile time\&.
