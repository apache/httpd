.SH NAME
logresolve \- Resolve IP-addresses to hostnames in Apache log files

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
logresolve is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in Apache's access logfiles\&. To minimize impact on your nameserver, logresolve has its very own internal hash-table cache\&. This means that each IP number will only be looked up the first time it is found in the log file\&.
 
.PP
Takes an Apache log file on standard input\&. The IP addresses must be the first thing on each line and must be separated from the remainder of the line by a space\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
-s \fIfilename\fR
Specifies a filename to record statistics\&.  
.TP
-c
This causes logresolve to apply some DNS checks: after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP addresses for the hostname and checks that one of these matches the original address\&.
