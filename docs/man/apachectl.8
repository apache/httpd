.SH NAME
apachectl \- Apache HTTP Server Control Interface

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
When acting in pass-through mode, apachectl can take all the arguments available for the httpd binary\&.

.PP
\fBapachectl\fR [ \fIhttpd-argument\fR ]

.PP
When acting in SysV init mode, apachectl takes simple, one-word commands, defined below\&.

.PP
\fBapachectl\fR\fIcommand\fR


.SH "SUMMARY"

.PP
apachectl is a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server\&. It is designed to help the administrator control the functioning of the Apache httpd daemon\&.

.PP
The apachectl script can operate in two modes\&. First, it can act as a simple front-end to the httpd command that simply sets any necessary environment variables and then invokes httpd, passing through any command line arguments\&. Second, apachectl can act as a SysV init script, taking simple one-word arguments like start, restart, and stop, and translating them into appropriate signals to httpd\&.

.PP
If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths, you will need to edit the apachectl script to set the appropriate paths to the httpd binary\&. You can also specify any necessary httpd command line arguments\&. See the comments in the script for details\&.

.PP
The apachectl script returns a 0 exit value on success, and >0 if an error occurs\&. For more details, view the comments in the script\&.


.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Only the SysV init-style options are defined here\&. Other arguments are defined on the httpd manual page\&.

.RS

.TP
start
Start the Apache httpd daemon\&. Gives an error if it is already running\&. This is equivalent to apachectl -k start\&.
.TP
stop
Stops the Apache httpd daemon\&. This is equivalent to apachectl -k stop\&.
.TP
restart
Restarts the Apache httpd daemon\&. If the daemon is not running, it is started\&. This command automatically checks the configuration files as in configtest before initiating the restart to make sure the daemon doesn't die\&. This is equivalent to apachectl -k restart\&.
.TP
fullstatus
Displays a full status report from mod_status\&. For this to work, you need to have mod_status enabled on your server and a text-based browser such as lynx available on your system\&. The URL used to access the status report can be set by editing the STATUSURL variable in the script\&.
.TP
status
Displays a brief status report\&. Similar to the fullstatus option, except that the list of requests currently being served is omitted\&.
.TP
graceful
Gracefully restarts the Apache httpd daemon\&. If the daemon is not running, it is started\&. This differs from a normal restart in that currently open connections are not aborted\&. A side effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately\&. This means that if used in a log rotation script, a substantial delay may be necessary to ensure that the old log files are closed before processing them\&. This command automatically checks the configuration files as in configtest before initiating the restart to make sure Apache doesn't die\&. This is equivalent to apachectl -k graceful\&.
.TP
configtest
Run a configuration file syntax test\&. It parses the configuration files and either reports Syntax Ok or detailed information about the particular syntax error\&. This is equivalent to apachectl -t\&.
.RE

.PP
The following additional option is available, but deprecated\&.

.RS

.TP
startssl
This is equivalent to apachectl -k start -DSSL\&. We recommend that you use that command explicitly, or you adjust your httpd\&.conf to remove the <IfDefine> section so that SSL will always be available\&.
