<title>htcacheclean - Clean up the disk cache</title>

<summary>
    <p><code>htcacheclean</code> is used to keep the size of
    <module>mod_disk_cache</module>'s storage within a certain limit. This
    tool can run either manually or in daemon mode. When running in
    daemon mode, it sleeps in the background and checks the cache directory
    at regular intervals for cached content to be removed. You can stop the daemon
    cleanly by sending it a TERM or INT signal. When run manually, a once off
    check of the cache directory is made for cached content to be removed. If
    one or more URLs are specified, each URL will be deleted from the cache, if
    present.</p>

<section id="options"><title>Options</title>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>-d<var>interval</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every <var>interval</var> minutes.
    This option is mutually exclusive with the <code>-D</code>, <code>-v</code>
    and <code>-r</code> options. To shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it
    a <code>SIGTERM</code> or <code>SIGINT</code>.</dd>

    <dt><code>-D</code></dt>
    <dd>Do a dry run and don't delete anything. This option is mutually
    exclusive with the <code>-d</code> option.</dd>

    <dt><code>-v</code></dt>
    <dd>Be verbose and print statistics. This option is mutually exclusive
    with the <code>-d</code> option.</dd>

    <dt><code>-r</code></dt>
    <dd>Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web server is
    not running (otherwise you may get garbage in the cache). This option
    is mutually exclusive with the <code>-d</code> option and implies
    the <code>-t</code> option.</dd>

    <dt><code>-n</code></dt>
    <dd>Be nice. This causes slower processing in favour of other
    processes. <code>htcacheclean</code> will sleep from time to time
    so that (a) the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule
    other processes in the meantime.</dd>

    <dt><code>-t</code></dt>
    <dd>Delete all empty directories. By default only cache files are
    removed, however with some configurations the large number of
    directories created may require attention. If your configuration
    requires a very large number of directories, to the point that
    inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become an issue, use 
    of this option is advised.</dd>

    <dt><code>-p<var>path</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Specify <var>path</var> as the root directory of the disk cache. This
    should be the same value as specified with the <directive
    module="mod_disk_cache">CacheRoot</directive> directive.</dd>

    <dt><code>-P<var>pidfile</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Specify <var>pidfile</var> as the name of the file to write the
    process ID to when daemonized.</dd>

    <dt><code>-l<var>limit</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Specify <var>limit</var> as the total disk cache size limit. The value
    is expressed in bytes by default (or attaching <code>B</code> to the
    number). Attach <code>K</code> for Kbytes or <code>M</code> for
    MBytes.</dd>

    <dt><code>-i</code></dt>
    <dd>Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the disk
    cache. This option is only possible together with the <code>-d</code>
    option.</dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section id="delete"><title>Deleting a specific URL</title>
    <p>If <code>htcacheclean</code> is passed one or more URLs, each URL will
    be deleted from the cache. If multiple variants of an URL exists, all
    variants would be deleted.</p>

    <p>When a reverse proxied URL is to be deleted, the effective URL is
    constructed from the <strong>Host</strong> header, the
    <strong>port</strong>, the <strong>path</strong> and the
    <strong>query</strong>. Note the '?' in the URL must always be specified
    explicitly, whether a query string is present or not. For example, an
    attempt to delete the path <strong>/</strong> from the server
    <strong>localhost</strong>, the URL to delete would be
    <strong>http://localhost:80/?</strong>.</p>

</section>
    
<section id="exit"><title>Exit Status</title>
    <p><code>htcacheclean</code> returns a zero status ("true") if all
    operations were successful, <code>1</code> otherwise. If an URL is
    specified, and the URL was cached and successfully removed,
    <code>0</code> is returned, <code>2</code> otherwise. If an error
    occurred during URL removal, <code>1</code> is returned.</p>
