  <title>rotatelogs - Piped logging program to rotate Apache logs</title>

<summary>
     <p><code>rotatelogs</code> is a simple program for use in
     conjunction with Apache's piped logfile feature.  It supports
     rotation based on a time interval or maximum size of the log.</p>

<section id="options"><title>Options</title>

<dl>

<dt><code>-l</code></dt>
<dd>Causes the use of local time rather than GMT as the base for the
interval or for <code>strftime(3)</code> formatting with size-based 
rotation.  Note that using <code>-l</code> in an environment which
changes the GMT offset (such as for BST or DST) can lead to unpredictable
results!</dd>

<dt><code>-L</code> <var>linkname</var></dt>
<dd>Causes a hard link to be made from the current logfile
to the specified link name.  This can be used to watch
the log continuously across rotations using a command like 
<code>tail -F linkname</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>-f</code></dt>
<dd>Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon as
<code>rotatelogs</code> starts, instead of waiting for the
first logfile entry to be read (for non-busy sites, there may be
a substantial delay between when the server is started
and when the first request is handled, meaning that the
associated logfile does not "exist" until then, which
causes problems from some automated logging tools)</dd>

<dt><code>-t</code></dt>
<dd>Causes the logfile to be truncated instead of rotated. This is
useful when a log is processed in real time by a command like tail,
and there is no need for archived data. No suffix will be added to
the filename, however format strings containing '%' characters
will be respected.
</dd>

<dt><code>-v</code></dt>
<dd>Produce verbose output on STDERR. The output contains
the result of the configuration parsing, and all file open and
close actions.</dd>

<dt><code><var>logfile</var></code></dt>

<dd>The path plus basename of the logfile.  If <var>logfile</var>
includes any '%' characters, it is treated as a format string for
<code>strftime(3)</code>.  Otherwise, the suffix
<var>.nnnnnnnnnn</var> is automatically added and is the time in
seconds (unless the -t option is used). Both formats compute the
start time from the beginning of the current period.  For example,
if a rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and
second fields created from the <code>strftime(3)</code> format will
all be zero, referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour
period (midnight).</dd>

<dt><code><var>rotationtime</var></code></dt>

<dd>The time between log file rotations in seconds.  The rotation
occurs at the beginning of this interval.  For example, if the
rotation time is 3600, the log file will be rotated at the beginning
of every hour; if the rotation time is 86400, the log file will be
rotated every night at midnight.  (If no data is logged during an
interval, no file will be created.)</dd>

<dt><code><var>filesize</var>(B|K|M|G)</code></dt>

<dd>The maximum file size in followed by exactly one of the letters
<code>B</code> (Bytes), <code>K</code> (KBytes), <code>M</code> (MBytes)
or <code>G</code> (GBytes).
<p>
When time and size are specified, the size must be given after the time.
Rotation will occur whenever either time or size limits are reached.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><code><var>offset</var></code></dt>

<dd>The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted, zero is
assumed and UTC is used.  For example, to use local time in the zone
UTC -5 hours, specify a value of <code>-300</code> for this argument.
In most cases, <code>-l</code> should be used instead of specifying
an offset.</dd>

<section id="examples"><title>Examples</title>

<example>
     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 86400" common
</example>

     <p>This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.nnnn where nnnn  is
     the system time at which the log nominally starts (this time
     will always be a multiple of the rotation time, so  you  can
     synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the end of each rotation
     time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.</p>

<example>
     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs -l /var/logs/logfile.%Y.%m.%d 86400" common
</example>

     <p>This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.yyyy.mm.dd where
     yyyy is the year, mm is the month, and dd is the day of the month.
     Logging will switch to a new file every day at midnight, local time.</p>

<example>
     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 5M" common
</example>

     <p>This configuration will rotate the logfile whenever it reaches
     a size of 5 megabytes.</p>

<example>
     ErrorLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/errorlog.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5M"
</example>
     <p>This configuration will rotate the error logfile whenever it
     reaches a size of 5 megabytes, and the suffix to the logfile name
     will be created of the form
     <code>errorlog.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS</code>.</p>
 
<example>
     CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs -t /var/logs/logfile 86400" common
</example>

     <p>This creates the file /var/logs/logfile, truncating the file at
     startup and then truncating the file once per day. It is expected
     in this scenario that a separate process (such as tail) would
     process the file in real time.</p>

<p>The following logfile format string substitutions should be
supported by all <code>strftime(3)</code> implementations, see
the <code>strftime(3)</code> man page for library-specific
extensions.</p>
