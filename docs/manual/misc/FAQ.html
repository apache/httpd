<OL START=1>
 <LI><A NAME="what">
      <STRONG>What is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache was originally based on code and ideas found in the most
  popular HTTP server of the time.. NCSA httpd 1.3 (early 1995). It has
  since evolved into a far superior system which can rival (and probably
  surpass) almost any other UNIX based HTTP server in terms of functionality,
  efficiency and speed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Since it began, it has been completely rewritten, and includes many new
  features. Apache is, as of January 1997, the most popular WWW server on
  the Internet, according to the
  <A
   HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/Survey/"
  >Netcraft Survey</A>.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A NAME="why">
      <STRONG>Why was Apache created?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  To address the concerns of a group of WWW providers and part-time httpd
  programmers that httpd didn't behave as they wanted it to behave.
  Apache is an entirely volunteer effort, completely funded by its 
  members, not by commercial sales.
  <HR>
  </P>
 </LI>
 <LI><A NAME="relate">
      <STRONG>How does The Apache Group's work relate to other
      server efforts, such as NCSA's?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  We, of course, owe a great debt to NCSA and their programmers for
  making the server Apache was based on. We now, however, have our own
  server, and our project is mostly our own. The Apache Project is an
  entirely independent venture.

  <P>
  A cute name which stuck. Apache is &quot;<STRONG>A
  PA</STRONG>t<STRONG>CH</STRONG>y server&quot;.  It was
  based on some existing code and a series of &quot;patch files&quot;.

  >Web Compare</A>'s 
  comparison chart.
  </P>
  <P>
  Apache has been shown to be substantially faster than many other
  free servers. Although certain commercial servers have claimed to
  surpass Apache's speed (it has not been demonstrated that any of these
  &quot;benchmarks&quot; are a good way of measuring WWW server speed at any
  rate), we feel that it is better to have a mostly-fast free server
  than an extremely-fast server that costs thousands of dollars. Apache
  is run on sites that get millions of hits per day, and they have
  experienced no performance difficulties.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A NAME="tested">
      <STRONG>How thoroughly tested is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache is run on over 400,000 Internet servers (as of April 1997). It has
  been tested thoroughly by both developers and users. The Apache Group
  maintains rigorous standards before releasing new versions of their
  server, and our server runs without a hitch on over one third of all
  WWW servers available on the Internet.  When bugs do show up, we
  release patches and new versions as soon as they are available.

  <OL>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the errorlog!</STRONG>
    <P>
    Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a problem.  In many
    cases, it will provide some details by writing one or messages to
    the server error log.  Sometimes this is enough for you to diagnose 
    &amp; fix the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the like).
    The default location of the error log is 
    <CODE>/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log</CODE>, but see the

  NCSA httpd appears to be moving toward adding experimental features

 <LI><A NAME="CGIoutsideScriptAlias">
      <STRONG>How do I enable CGI execution in directories other than

  <P>
  Apache recognizes all files in a directory named as a
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias"
  ><SAMP>ScriptAlias</SAMP></A>
  as being eligible for execution rather than processing as normal
  documents.  This applies regardless of the file name, so scripts in a
  ScriptAlias directory don't need to be named
  &quot;<SAMP>*.cgi</SAMP>&quot; or &quot;<SAMP>*.pl</SAMP>&quot; or
  whatever.  In other words, <EM>all</EM> files in a ScriptAlias
  directory are scripts, as far as Apache is concerned.
  </P>
  <P>
  To persuade Apache to execute scripts in other locations, such as in
  directories where normal documents may also live, you must tell it how
  to recognize them - and also that it's okay to execute them.  For
  this, you need to use something like the
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"
  ><SAMP>AddHandler</SAMP></A>
  directive.

    The server will then recognize that all files in that location (and

      <STRONG>What does it mean when my CGIs fail with
      &quot;<SAMP>Premature end of script headers</SAMP>&quot;?</STRONG>
     </A> 
  <P>
  It means just what it says: the server was expecting a complete set of
  HTTP headers (one or more followed by a blank line), and didn't get
  them.  The most common cause of this (aside from people not
  outputting the required headers at all) a result of an interaction
  with perl's output buffering.  To make perl flush its buffers 
  after each output statement, insert the following statements before your
  first <CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>write</CODE> statement:
  </P>
  <P>
  <CODE>
   <DL>
    <DD>$cfh = select (STDOUT);
    </DD>
    <DD>$| = 1;
    </DD>
    <DD>select ($cfh);
    </DD>
   </DL>
  </CODE>
  </P>
  <P>
  This is generally only necessary when you are calling external 
  programs from your script that send output to stdout.  
  <P>
  If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent thing for

  Since the server is performing run-time processing of your SSI

  can't know at the time it starts parsing what the final size of the
  result will be, or whether the parsed result will always be the same.
  This means that it can't generate <SAMP>Content-Length</SAMP> or
  <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> headers.  Caches commonly work by comparing
  the <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> of what's in the cache with that being
  delivered by the server.  Since the server isn't sending that header
  for a parsed document, whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether
  the document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be on the
  safe side.

  <P>
  You are probably running into resource limitations in your 
  operating system.  The most common limitation is the 
  <EM>per</EM>-process limit on <STRONG>file descriptors</STRONG>, 
  which is almost always the cause of problems seen when adding 
  virtual hosts.  Apache often does not give an intuitive error 
  message because it is normally some library routine (such as 
  <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE>) which needs file descriptors and 
  doesn't complain intelligibly when it can't get them.  
  </P>
  <P>
  Each log file requires a file descriptor, which means that if you are
  using separate access and error logs for each virtual host, each
  virtual host needs two file descriptors.  Each 
  <A
   HREF="../mod/core.html#listen"
  ><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>
  directive also needs a file descriptor.  
  </P>
  <P>
  Typical values for &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt; that we've seen are in
  the neighborhood of 128 or 250.  When the server bumps into the file
  descriptor limit, it may dump core with a SIGSEGV, it might just
  hang, or it may limp along and you'll see (possibly meaningful) errors
  in the error log.  One common problem that occurs when you run into
  a file descriptor limit is that CGI scripts stop being executed

  <UL>
   <LI>The Web technology provides no governors on how often or how

    similar mass attack, just as fast as the wire and your server can
    handle the requests.  Most operating systems these days include
    attack detection (such as <EM>n</EM> failed passwords for the same
    account within <EM>m</EM> seconds) and evasion (breaking the
    connection, disabling the account under attack, disabling
    <EM>all</EM> logins from that source, <EM>et cetera</EM>), but the
    Web does not.
   </LI>
   <LI>An account under attack isn't notified (unless the server is
    heavily modified); there's no &quot;You have 19483 login
    failures&quot; message when the legitimate owner logs in.
   </LI>
   <LI>Without an exhaustive and error-prone examination of the server
    logs, you can't tell whether an account has been compromised.
    Detecting that an attack has occurred, or is in progress, is fairly
    obvious, though - <EM>if</EM> you look at the logs.
   </LI>
   <LI>Web authentication passwords (at least for Basic authentication)
    generally fly across the wire, and through intermediate proxy
    systems, in what amounts to plaintext.  &quot;O'er the net we
    go/Caching all the way;/O what fun it is to surf/Giving my password
    away!&quot;
   </LI>
   <LI>Since HTTP is stateless, information about the authentication is
    transmitted <EM>each and every time</EM> a request is made to the
    server.  Essentially, the client caches it after the first
    successful access, and transmits it without asking for all
    subsequent requests to the same server.
   </LI>

  As of version 1.2, Apache is an HTTP/1.1 (HyperText Transfer Protocol
  version 1.1) server.  This fact is reflected in the protocol version
  that's included in the response headers sent to a client when
  processing a request.  Unfortunately, the URL methods (URLConnection
  and friends) in the Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 1.0.2 through
  1.1.1 expect to see the version string &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot; and do not
  correctly interpret the &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; value Apache is sending
  (this part of the response is a declaration of what the server can do
  rather than a declaration of the dialect of the response).  The result
  is that the JDK methods do not correctly parse the headers, and
  include them with the document content by mistake.
  </P>

  This is definitely a bug in the JDK, but it's unclear when (or

      <STRONG>Why doesn't Apache include SSL?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  SSL (Secure Socket Layer) data transport requires encryption, and many
  governments have restrictions upon the import, export, and use of
  encryption technology.  If Apache included SSL in the base package,
  its distribution would involve all sorts of legal and bureaucratic
  issues, and it would no longer be freely available.  Also, some of
  the technology required to talk to current clients using SSL is 
  patented by <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data Security</A>, 
  who restricts its use without a license.
  </P>
  <P>
  Some SSL implementations of Apache are available, however; see the
  &quot;<A

  <P>
  Even though the registered MIME type for MIDI files is
  <SAMP>audio/midi</SAMP>, some browsers are not set up to recognize it
  as such; instead, they look for <SAMP>audio/x-midi</SAMP>.  There are
  two things you can do to address this:
  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI>Configure your browser to treat documents of type
    <SAMP>audio/midi</SAMP> correctly.  This is the type that Apache
    sends by default.  This may not be workable, however, if you have
    many client installations to change, or if some or many of the
    clients are not under your control.

   <LI>Instruct Apache to send a different <SAMP>Content-type</SAMP>

     </DD>
    </DL>
    <P>
    Note that this may break browsers that <EM>do</EM> recognize the
    <SAMP>audio/midi</SAMP> MIME type unless they're prepared to also
    handle <SAMP>audio/x-midi</SAMP> the same way.

  <P>
  If the server won't compile on your system, it is probably due to one
  of the following causes:
  </P>
  <UL>
   <LI><STRONG>The <SAMP>Configure</SAMP> script doesn't recognize your system
    environment.</STRONG>
    <BR>
    This might be either because it's completely unknown or because
    the specific environment (include files, OS version, <EM>et
    cetera</EM>) isn't explicitly handled.  If this happens, you may
    need to port the server to your OS yourself.
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Your system's C compiler is garbage.</STRONG>
    <BR>
    Some operating systems include a default C compiler that is either
    not ANSI C-compliant or suffers from other deficiencies.  The usual
    recommendation in cases like this is to acquire, install, and use
    <SAMP>gcc</SAMP>.
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Your <SAMP>include</SAMP> files may be confused.</STRONG>
    <BR>
    In some cases, we have found that a compiler installation or system
    upgrade has left the C header files in an inconsistent state.  Make
    sure that your include directory tree is in sync with the compiler and
    the operating system.
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Your operating system or compiler may be out of
    revision.</STRONG> 
    <BR>
    Software vendors (including those that develop operating systems)
    issue new releases for a reason; sometimes to add functionality, but
    more often to fix bugs that have been discovered.  Try upgrading
    your compiler and/or your operating system.
   </LI>

  <P>
  The Apache Group tests the ability to build the server on many
  different platforms.  Unfortunately, we can't test all of the OS
  platforms there are.  If you have verified that none of the above

  before, please submit a
  <A

 <LI><A NAME="addlog">
      <STRONG>How do I add browsers and referrers to my logs?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache provides a couple of different ways of doing this.  The
  recommended method is to compile the
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_log_config</SAMP></A>
  module into your configuration and use the
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog"
  ><SAMP>CustomLog</SAMP></A>
  directive.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can either log the additional information in files other than your
  normal transfer log, or you can add them to the records already being
  written.  For example:
  </P>
  <P>
  <CODE>
   CustomLog&nbsp;logs/access_log&nbsp;"%h&nbsp;%l&nbsp;%u&nbsp;%t&nbsp;\"%r\"&nbsp;%s&nbsp;%b&nbsp;\"%{Referer}i\"&nbsp;\"%{User-Agent}i\""
  </CODE>
  </P>
  <P>
  This will add the values of the <SAMP>User-agent:</SAMP> and
  <SAMP>Referer:</SAMP> headers, which indicate the client and the
  referring page, respectively, to the end of each line in the access
  log.

      <STRONG>Why do Java applets and applications not work

     </A>
  <P>
  The Java Development Kit (JDK) libraries versions 1.0.2 and 1.1 do not
  correctly interpret the &quot;<SAMP>HTTP/1.1</SAMP>&quot; response
  header that Apache 1.2 sends.  Instead, if they don't see an exact
  match for &quot;<SAMP>HTTP/1.0</SAMP>&quot;, they assume the headers
  are part of the document content.
  </P>
  <P>
  This is a known problem, and it has been reported to Sun's JavaSoft
  unit.  In the meantime, Apache 1.2 servers can work around this by
  adding the following lines to their configuration files:
