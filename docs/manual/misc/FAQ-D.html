      <STRONG>Why do I get &quot;<SAMP>setgid: Invalid
      argument</SAMP>&quot; at startup?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Your
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#group"><SAMP>Group</SAMP></A>
  directive (probably in <SAMP>conf/httpd.conf</SAMP>) needs to name a
  group that actually exists in the <SAMP>/etc/group</SAMP> file (or
  your system's equivalent).  This problem is also frequently seen when
  a negative number is used in the <CODE>Group</CODE> directive
  (<EM>e.g.</EM>, "<CODE>Group&nbsp;#-1</CODE>").  Using a group name
  -- not group number -- found in your system's group database should
  solve this problem in all cases.
  </P>

      <STRONG>Why am I getting &quot;<SAMP>httpd: could not set socket
      option TCP_NODELAY</SAMP>&quot; in my error log?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  This message almost always indicates that the client disconnected
  before Apache reached the point of calling <CODE>setsockopt()</CODE>
  for the connection.  It shouldn't occur for more than about 1% of the
  requests your server handles, and it's advisory only in any case.
  </P>

 <LI><A NAME="peerreset">
      <STRONG>Why am I getting &quot;<SAMP>connection reset by
      peer</SAMP>&quot; in my error log?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  This is a normal message and nothing about which to be alarmed.  It simply
  means that the client canceled the connection before it had been
  completely set up - such as by the end-user pressing the &quot;Stop&quot;
  button.  People's patience being what it is, sites with response-time
  problems or slow network links may experiences this more than
  high-capacity ones or those with large pipes to the network.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="wheres-the-dump">
      <STRONG>The errorlog says Apache dumped core, but where's the dump
      file?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  In Apache version 1.2, the error log message
  about dumped core includes the directory where the dump file should be
  located.  However, many Unixes do not allow a process that has
  called <CODE>setuid()</CODE> to dump core for security reasons;
  the typical Apache setup has the server started as root to bind to
  port 80, after which it changes UIDs to a non-privileged user to
  serve requests.
  </P>
  <P>
  Dealing with this is extremely operating system-specific, and may
  require rebuilding your system kernel.  Consult your operating system
  documentation or vendor for more information about whether your system
  does this and how to bypass it.  If there <EM>is</EM> a documented way
  of bypassing it, it is recommended that you bypass it only for the
  <SAMP>httpd</SAMP> server process if possible.
  </P>
  <P>
  The canonical location for Apache's core-dump files is the
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</A>
  directory. As of Apache version 1.3, the location can be set <EM>via</EM>
  the
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#coredumpdirectory"
  ><SAMP>CoreDumpDirectory</SAMP></A>
  directive to a different directory. Make sure that this directory is
  writable by the user the server runs as (as opposed to the user the server
  is <EM>started</EM> as).

 <LI><A NAME="linux-shmget">
      <STRONG>When I run it under Linux I get &quot;shmget:
      function not found&quot;, what should I do?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Your kernel has been built without SysV IPC support.  You will have
  to rebuild the kernel with that support enabled (it's under the
  &quot;General Setup&quot; submenu).  Documentation for kernel
  building is beyond the scope of this FAQ; you should consult the <A
  HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" >Kernel
  HOWTO</A>, or the documentation provided with your distribution, or
  a <A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/HOWTO/META-FAQ.html" >Linux
  newsgroup/mailing list</A>.  As a last-resort workaround, you can
  comment out the <CODE>#define&nbsp;USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD</CODE>
  definition in the <SAMP>LINUX</SAMP> section of
  <SAMP>src/conf.h</SAMP> and rebuild the server (prior to 1.3b4,
  simply removing <CODE>#define&nbsp;HAVE_SHMGET</CODE> would have
  sufficed).  This will produce a server which is slower and less
  reliable.

 <LI><A NAME="nfslocking">
      <STRONG>Server hangs, or fails to start, and/or error log

     </A>

  <P>
  These are symptoms of a fine locking problem, which usually means that
  the server is trying to use a synchronization file on an NFS filesystem.
  </P>
  <P>
  Because of its parallel-operation model, the Apache Web server needs to
  provide some form of synchronization when accessing certain resources.
  One of these synchronization methods involves taking out locks on a file,
  which means that the filesystem whereon the lockfile resides must support
  locking.  In many cases this means it <EM>can't</EM> be kept on an
  NFS-mounted filesystem.
  </P>
  <P>
  To cause the Web server to work around the NFS locking limitations, include
  a line such as the following in your server configuration files:
  </P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>LockFile /var/run/apache-lock</CODE>
   </DD>
  </DL>
  <P>
  The directory should not be generally writable (<EM>e.g.</EM>, don't use
  <SAMP>/var/tmp</SAMP>).
  See the <A HREF="../mod/core.html#lockfile"><SAMP>LockFile</SAMP></A>
  documentation for more information.

   <P>
   This is a known problem with certain versions of the AIX C compiler.
   IBM are working on a solution, and the issue is being tracked by
   <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/2312">problem report #2312</A>.

 <LI><A NAME="redhat">
      <STRONG>I'm using RedHat Linux and I have problems with httpd
      dying randomly or not restarting properly</STRONG>
     </A>

  <P>
  RedHat Linux versions 4.x (and possibly earlier) RPMs contain
  various nasty scripts which do not stop or restart Apache properly.
  These can affect you even if you're not running the RedHat supplied
  RPMs.
  </P>
  <P>
  If you're using the default install then you're probably running
  Apache 1.1.3, which is outdated.  From RedHat's ftp site you can
  pick up a more recent RPM for Apache 1.2.x.  This will solve one of
  the problems.
  </P>
  <P>
  If you're using a custom built Apache rather than the RedHat RPMs
  then you should <CODE>rpm -e apache</CODE>.  In particular you want
  the mildly broken <CODE>/etc/logrotate.d/apache</CODE> script to be
  removed, and you want the broken <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd</CODE>
  (or <CODE>httpd.init</CODE>) script to be removed.  The latter is
  actually fixed by the apache-1.2.5 RPMs but if you're building your
  own Apache then you probably don't want the RedHat files.
  </P>
  <P>
  We can't stress enough how important it is for folks, <EM>especially
  vendors</EM> to follow the <A HREF="../stopping.html">stopping Apache
  directions</A> given in our documentation.  In RedHat's defense,
  the broken scripts were necessary with Apache 1.1.x because the
  Linux support in 1.1.x was very poor, and there were various race
  conditions on all platforms.  None of this should be necessary with
  Apache 1.2 and later.

 <LI><A NAME="stopping">
      <STRONG>I upgraded from an Apache version earlier
      than 1.2.0 and suddenly I have problems with Apache dying randomly
      or not restarting properly</STRONG>
     </A>

  <P>
  You should read <A HREF="#redhat">the previous note</A> about
  problems with RedHat installations.  It is entirely likely that your
  installation has start/stop/restart scripts which were built for
  an earlier version of Apache.  Versions earlier than 1.2.0 had
  various race conditions that made it necessary to use
  <CODE>kill -9</CODE> at times to take out all the httpd servers.
  But that should not be necessary any longer.  You should follow
  the <A HREF="../stopping.html">directions on how to stop
  and restart Apache</A>.
  </P>
  <P>As of Apache 1.3 there is a script
  <CODE>src/support/apachectl</CODE> which, after a bit of
  customization, is suitable for starting, stopping, and restarting
  your server.

  <p>
  It means what it says; the Apache software can't determine the
  hostname of your system.  Edit your <samp>conf\httpd.conf</samp>
  file, look for the string "ServerName", and make sure there's an
  uncommented directive such as
  </p>
  <dl>
   <dd><code>ServerName localhost</code></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
  or
  </p>
  <dl>
   <dd><code>ServerName www.foo.com</code></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
  in the file.  Correct it if there one there with wrong information, or
  add one if you don't already have one.  Then try to start the server
  again.
