<H3><A NAME="what">What is suEXEC?</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The <STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> feature -- introduced in Apache 1.2 -- provides
Apache users the ability to run <STRONG>CGI</STRONG> and <STRONG>SSI</STRONG>
programs under user IDs different from the user ID of the calling web-server.
Normally, when a CGI or SSI program executes, it runs as the same user who is
running the web server.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Used properly, this feature can reduce considerably the security risks involved
with allowing users to develop and run private CGI or SSI programs.  However,
if suEXEC is improperly configured, it can cause any number of problems and
possibly create new holes in your computer's security.  If you aren't familiar
with managing setuid root programs and the security issues they present, we
highly recommend that you not consider using suEXEC.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="before">Before we begin.</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Before jumping head-first into this document, you should be aware of the
assumptions made on the part of the Apache Group and this document.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
First, it is assumed that you are using a UNIX derivate operating system that
is capable of <STRONG>setuid</STRONG> and <STRONG>setgid</STRONG> operations.
All command examples are given in this regard.  Other platforms, if they are
capable of supporting suEXEC, may differ in their configuration.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Second, it is assumed you are familiar with some basic concepts of your
computer's security and its administration.  This involves an understanding
of <STRONG>setuid/setgid</STRONG> operations and the various effects they
may have on your system and its level of security.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Third, it is assumed that you are using an <STRONG>unmodified</STRONG>
version of suEXEC code.  All code for suEXEC has been carefully scrutinized and
tested by the developers as well as numerous beta testers.  Every precaution has
been taken to ensure a simple yet solidly safe base of code.  Altering this
code can cause unexpected problems and new security risks.  It is
<STRONG>highly</STRONG> recommended you not alter the suEXEC code unless you
are well versed in the particulars of security programming and are willing to
share your work with the Apache Group for consideration.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Fourth, and last, it has been the decision of the Apache Group to
<STRONG>NOT</STRONG> make suEXEC part of the default installation of Apache.
To this end, suEXEC configuration requires of the administrator careful
attention to details.  After due consideration has been given to the various
settings for suEXEC, the administrator may install suEXEC through normal
installation methods. The values for these settings need to be carefully
determined and specified by the administrator to properly maintain system
security during the use of suEXEC functionality.  It is through this detailed
process that the Apache Group hopes to limit suEXEC installation only to those
who are careful and determined enough to use it.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Still with us?  Yes?  Good.  Let's move on!

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<STRONG><A HREF="suexec.html">BACK TO CONTENTS</A></STRONG>

<H3><A NAME="model">suEXEC Security Model</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Before we begin configuring and installing suEXEC, we will first discuss
the security model you are about to implement.  By doing so, you may
better understand what exactly is going on inside suEXEC and what precautions
are taken to ensure your system's security.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> is based on a setuid "wrapper" program that is
called by the main Apache web server.  This wrapper is called when an HTTP
request is made for a CGI or SSI program that the administrator has designated
to run as a userid other than that of the main server.  When such a request
is made, Apache provides the suEXEC wrapper with the program's name and the
user and group IDs under which the program is to execute.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The wrapper then employs the following process to determine success or
failure -- if any one of these conditions fail, the program logs the failure
and exits with an error, otherwise it will continue:

        <LI><STRONG>Was the wrapper called with the proper number of arguments?</STRONG>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        The wrapper will only execute if it is given the proper number of arguments.
        The proper argument format is known to the Apache web server.  If the wrapper
        is not receiving the proper number of arguments, it is either being hacked, or
        there is something wrong with the suEXEC portion of your Apache binary.

This is the standard operation of the the suEXEC wrapper's security model.
It is somewhat stringent and can impose new limitations and guidelines for
CGI/SSI design, but it was developed carefully step-by-step with security
in mind.

If your installation requires location of the wrapper program in a different

After properly installing the <STRONG>suexec</STRONG> wrapper

One way to use <STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> is through the

the <STRONG>User</STRONG> and <STRONG>Group</STRONG> defined for that
<STRONG>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</STRONG>. If only one or
neither of these directives are specified for a
<STRONG>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</STRONG> then the main

<STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> can also be used to to execute CGI programs as
the user to which the request is being directed. This is accomplished by
using the <STRONG>~</STRONG> character prefixing the user ID for whom
execution is desired.

        <LI>Hierarchy limitations
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        For security and efficiency reasons, all suexec requests must
        remain within either a top-level document root for virtual
        host requests, or one top-level personal document root for
        userdir requests.  For example, if you have four VirtualHosts
        configured, you would need to structure all of your VHosts'
        document roots off of one main Apache document hierarchy to
        take advantage of suEXEC for VirtualHosts. (Example forthcoming.)

        </LI>
        <LI>suEXEC's PATH environment variable
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        This can be a dangerous thing to change.  Make certain every
        path you include in this define is a <STRONG>trusted</STRONG>
        directory.  You don't want to open people up to having someone
