    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>
    Apache 2.0 is designed to run on NetWare 5.x and above. 

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.0 you must install Service
    Pack 7 or above.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.1 you must install Service
    Pack 4 or above.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 6 you must install Service
    Pack 1 or above.</strong></p>

    <p>NetWare service packs are available <a
    href="http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw">here.</a></p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for NetWare</a></h2>

    <p>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on
    the Apache web server at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>. This
    will list the current release, any more recent alpha or
    beta-test releases, together with details of mirror web and
    anonymous ftp sites.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Installing Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    There is no Apache install program for NetWare currently. You
    will need to compile apache and copy the files over to the
    server manually. An install program will be posted at a later
    date.&nbsp;

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare from the
    binary download (assuming you will install to sys:/apache2):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unzip the binary download file to the root of the SYS:
      volume (may be installed to any volume)</li>

      <li>Edit the httpd.conf file setting ServerRoot and
      ServerName to reflect your correct server settings</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE2 to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare manually
    from your own build source (assuming you will install to
    sys:/apache):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a directory called <code>Apache2</code> on a
      NetWare volume</li>

      <li>Copy APACHE2.NLM, APRLIB.NLM, HTDIGEST.NLM, HTPASSWD.NLM to SYS:/APACHE2</li>

      <li>Create a directory under SYS:/APACHE2 called CONF</li>

      <li>Copy the HTTPD-STD.CONF file to the SYS:/APACHE2/CONF
      directory and rename to HTTPD.CONF</li>

      <li>Copy the MIME.TYPES and MAGIC files to SYS:/APACHE2/CONF
      directory</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \HTTPD-2.0\DOCS\ICONS to
        SYS:/APACHE2/ICONS</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \HTTPD-2.0\DOCS\MANUAL to
        SYS:/APACHE2/MANUAL</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \HTTPD-2.0\DOCS\ERROR to
        SYS:/APACHE2/ERROR</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \HTTPD-2.0\DOCS\DOCROOT to
        SYS:/APACHE2/HTDOCS</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE2/LOGS on the server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE2/CGI-BIN on the
      server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE2/MODULES and copy all nlm
      modules into the modules directory</li>

      <li>Edit the HTTPD.CONF file searching for all @@<i>Value</i>@@ markers
        and replacing them with the appropriate setting</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE2 to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apache may be installed to other volumes besides the default <samp>SYS</samp> volume.</p>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for NetWare</a></h2>
    To start Apache just type <strong>apache</strong> at the
    console. This will load apache in the OS address space. If you
    prefer to load Apache in a protected address space you may
    specify the address space with the load statement as follows: 
<pre>
    load address space = apache2 apache2
</pre>

    <p>This will load Apache into an address space called apache.
    Running multiple instances of Apache concurrently on NetWare is
    possible by loading each instance into its own protected
    address space.</p>

    <p>After starting Apache, it will be listening to port 80
    (unless you changed the <samp>Listen</samp> directive in the configuration
    files). To connect to the server and access the default page,
    launch a browser and enter the server's name or address. This
    should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the Apache
    manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in the
    <samp>error_log</samp> file in the <samp>logs</samp>
    directory.</p>

    <p>Once your basic installation is working, you should
    configure it properly by editing the files in the
    <samp>conf</samp> directory.</p>

    <p>To unload Apache running in the OS address space just type
    the following at the console:</p>
<pre>
    unload apache2</pre>
    <blockquote>
<pre>or</pre>
    </blockquote>
<pre>    apache2 shutdown
</pre>
    If apache is running in a protected address space specify the
    address space in the unload statement: 
<pre>
    unload address space = apache2 apache2
</pre>

    <p>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will
    find the configuration files. You can specify a configuration
    file on the command line in two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration
      file</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache2 -f &quot;vol:/my server/conf/my.conf&quot;
</pre>
<pre>
    apache -f test/test.conf
</pre>
    In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the
    configuration file. 

    <p>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f,
    Apache will use the file name compiled into the server, usually
    "conf/httpd.conf". Invoking Apache with the -V switch will
    display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Apache will
    then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in this
    order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.</li>

      <li>The -d switch on the command line.</li>

      <li>Current working directory</li>

      <li>The server root compiled into the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The server root compiled into the server is usually &quot;sys:/apache2&quot;. invoking apache with the -V switch will display
    this value labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</p>

    <p>Apache 2.0 for NetWare includes a set of command line directives that can
    be used to modify or display information about the running instance of the
    web server.&nbsp; Each of these directives must be preceded by the keyword
    APACHE2:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>RESTART - Instructs Apache to terminate all running worker threads as
        they become idle, reread the configuration file and restart each worker
        thread based on the new configuration.</li>
      <li>VERSION - Displays version information about the currently running
        instance of Apache.</li>
      <li>MODULES - Displays a list of loaded modules both built-in and
        external.</li>
      <li>DIRECTIVES - Displays a list of all available directives.</li>
      <li>SETTINGS - Enables or disables the thread status display on the
        console.&nbsp; When enabled, a status of the number of running threads
        is displayed along with their status.</li>
      <li>SHUTDOWN - Terminates the running instance of the Apache web server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="use" name="use">Configuring Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    Apache is configured by files in the <samp>conf</samp>
    directory. These are the same as files used to configure the
    Unix version, but there are a few different directives for
    Apache on NetWare. See the <a href="./">Apache
    documentation</a> for all the available directives. 

    <p>The main differences in Apache for NetWare are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Because Apache for NetWare is multithreaded, it does not
        use a separate process for each request, as Apache does in some Unix
        implementations. Instead there are only threads running: a parent
        thread, and a multiple child threads which handle the requests.&nbsp; So the "process"-management directives are
        different:</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</a>
        - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests
        a worker thread will serve before exiting. The recommended default, <code>MaxRequestsPerChild
        0</code>, causes the thread to continue servicing request indefinitely.&nbsp;
        It is recommended on NetWare, unless there is some specific reason, that
        this directive always remain set to 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#startthreads">StartThreads</a> -
        This directive tells the server how many
        threads it should start initially. The recommended default is <code>StartThreads
        50</code>.</p>
        
        <p><a
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#minsparethreads">MinSpareThreads</a> -
        This directive instructs the server to spawn additional worker threads
        if the number of idle threads ever falls below this value. The recommended default is
        <code>MinSpareThreads 10</code>.</p>
        
        <p><a
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#maxsparethreads">MaxSpareThreads</a> -
        This directive instructs the server to begin terminating worker threads
        if the number of idle threads ever exceeds this value. The recommended default is
        <code>MaxSpareThreads 100</code>.</p>
        
        <p><a
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#maxthreads">MaxThreads</a> -
        This directive limits the total number of work threads to a maximum
        value. The recommended default is <code>ThreadsPerChild 250</code>.</p>
        
        <p><a 
        href="mod/mpm_netware.html#threadstacksize">ThreadStackSize</a>
        - This directive tells the server what size of stack to use
        for the individual worker thread. The recommended default is
        <code>ThreadStackSize 65536</code>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now
        must use NetWare filenames instead of Unix ones. However,
        because Apache uses Unix-style names internally, you must
        use forward slashes, not backslashes. It is recommended that all rooted
        file paths begin with a volume name.&nbsp; If omitted, Apache will
        assume the SYS: volume.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache for NetWare has the ability to load modules at
        runtime, without recompiling the server. If Apache is
        compiled normally, it will install a number of optional
        modules in the <code>\Apache2\modules</code> directory. To
        activate these, or other modules, the <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a> directive
        must be used. For example, to active the status module, use
        the following (in addition to the status-activating
        directives in <code>access.conf</code>):</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule status_module modules/status.nlm
</pre>

        <p>Information on <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
        modules</a> is also available.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="comp" name="comp">Compiling Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>

    <p>Compiling Apache requires MetroWerks CodeWarrior 6.x or
    higher to be properly installed.&nbsp; Once Apache has been built, it needs to be installed on a NetWare
    volume's root directory. The default is the
    <code>sys:/Apache2</code> directory.</p>

    <p>Before running the server you must fill out the conf
    directory. Copy the file HTTPD-STD.CONF from the distribution conf
    directory and rename it to HTTPD.CONF. Edit the HTTPD.CONF file searching for all @@<i>Value</i>@@ markers
        and replacing them with the appropriate setting. Copy over
    the conf/magic and conf/mime.types files as well.</p>

    
    <p><b><u>

    
	Requirements:&nbsp;</u></b></p>
    <p>
	The following development tools are required to build Apache 2.0
	for NetWare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Metrowerks CodeWarrior 6.0 or higher with the <a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/cwpdk.htm"> NetWare PDK
        3.0 </a>
   or higher.&nbsp;</li>
      <li><a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/libc.htm">NetWare Libraries
        for C (LibC)</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/ws2comp.htm">WinSock 2
        Developer Components for NetWare</a></li>
      <li>To build using either the project file or the make files, requires an AWK utility (awk, gawk or
        similar).&nbsp; AWK can be downloaded from&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/apache.htm">http://developer.novell.com/ndk/apache.htm</a>. The
   utility must be found in your windows path and must be named awk.exe.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>To build using the makefiles, you will need GNU make version 3.78.1 (GMake)
        available at <a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/apache.htm">http://developer.novell.com/ndk/apache.htm</a>.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><u>Building Apache using the Metrowerks Project Files:&nbsp;</u></b></p>

    <p>All major pieces of Apache and APR are built using the
    ApacheNW.mcp and LibAprNW.mcp project files. This includes modules such as
    status, info, proxy, etc.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set the environment variable &quot;NovellLibC&quot; to the
        location of the NetWare Libraries for C SDK (ex. Set NovellLibC=c:\novell\ndk\libc).</li>
      <li>Make sure that the path to the CodeWarrior command line tools (MWCCNLM.exe,
        MWLDNLM.exe) has been included in the system's PATH environment
        variable.</li>
      <li>Make sure that the path to the AWK utility has been included in the
        system's PATH environment variable.</li>
      <li>Download the source code and unzip to an appropriate directory on
     your workstation.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\srclib\apr\build and run the batch file
     prebuildnw.bat.  The batch file will setup the build environment
     for building the APR libraries.  It will also run 2 AWK scripts
     that will generate the export files for APR.</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\srclib\apr and extract the project file
        LIBAPRNW.mcp from the LIBAPRNW.mcp.zip file.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Open the LIBAPRNW.mcp project file in the Metrowerks IDE.</li>
      <li>Select the target "Build Util - Gen URL Delim" and build the target.
     This target will produce the NLM &quot;GENURI.nlm&quot;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Copy the file GENURI.nlm to the SYS: volume of a NetWare server and 
     run using the following command:&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>SYS:\genuri&nbsp; &gt; sys:\uri_delims.h&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Copy the file "uri_delims.h" to the directory \httpd\srclib\apr-util\uri
     on the build machine.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Select the target "APR Debug NLM&quot; or &quot;APR Release NLM&quot; in the IDE and build.  This will 
     produce the file APRLIB.nlm.&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li><i>OPTIONAL</i>: Select any of the LIB targets to produce a
            statically linkable libraries.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\build and run the batch file prebuildnw.bat.
     This batch file will setup the build environment for building the
     APACHE.nlm.  It will also run several AWK scripts that will 
     generate the export files for APACHE.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \http and extract the project file ApacheNW.mcp
        from the ApacheNW.mcp.zip file.</li>
      <li>Open the ApacheNW.mcp project file in the Metrowerks IDE.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Select the target "Build Utility - DFTables" and build the target.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Select the target "Build Util - Gen Test Chars" and build the target.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Copy the files "GENCHARS.nlm" and "DFTABLES.nlm" to the SYS:
     volume of a NetWare server and run using the following commands:&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>SYS:\genchars &gt; sys:\test_char.h&nbsp;</li>
          <li>SYS:\dftables&nbsp; &gt; sys:\chartables.c&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Copy the files "test_char.h" and "chartables.c" to the directory
     \httpd\os\netware on the build machine.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Select the target "Apache Full Debug&quot; or &quot;Apache Full
        Release&quot; in the IDE and build.  This will
     produce the file APACHE2.nlm along with all of the external module NLMs. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b><u>Building Apache using the NetWare makefiles:&nbsp;</u></b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the environment variable &quot;NOVELLLIBC&quot; to the
        location of the NetWare Libraries for C SDK (ex. Set NOVELLLIBC=c:\novell\ndk\libc).</li>
      <li>Set the environment variable &quot;METROWERKS&quot; to the
        location where you installed the Metrowerks CodeWarrior compiler (ex. Set
        METROWERKS=C:\Program Files\Metrowerks\CodeWarrior).&nbsp; If you
        installed to the default location C:\Program
        Files\Metrowerks\CodeWarrior, you don't need to set this.</li>
      <li>Set the environment variable &quot;AP_WORK&quot; to the full path of
        the \httpd directory.</li>
      <li>Set the environment variable &quot;APR_WORK&quot; to the full path of
        the \httpd\srclib\apr directory.</li>
      <li>Make sure that the path to the AWK utility and the GNU make utility (gmake.exe)
        have been included in the
        system's PATH environment variable.</li>
      <li>Download the source code and unzip to an appropriate directory on
     your workstation.</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\srclib\apr-util\uri and build GENURI.nlm by
        running &quot;gmake -f nwgnumakefile&quot;</li>
      <li>Copy the file GENURI.nlm to the SYS: volume of a NetWare server and 
     run using the following command:&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>SYS:\genuri&nbsp; &gt; sys:\uri_delims.h&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Copy the file "uri_delims.h" to the directory \httpd\srclib\apr-util\uri
     on the build machine.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\srclib\apr and build APR by running &quot;gmake
        -f nwgnumakefile&quot;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\srclib\pcre and build DFTABLES.nlm by
        running &quot;gmake -f nwgnumakefile&quot;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd\server and build GNECHARS.nlm by running
        &quot;gmake -f nwgnumakefile&quot;</li>
      <li>Copy the files "GENCHARS.nlm" and "DFTABLES.nlm" from their respective
        directories to the SYS:
     volume of a NetWare server and run them using the following commands:&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>SYS:\genchars &gt; sys:\test_char.h&nbsp;</li>
          <li>SYS:\dftables&nbsp; &gt; sys:\chartables.c&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Copy the files "test_char.h" and "chartables.c" to the directory
     \httpd\os\netware on the build machine.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Change directory to \httpd and build Apache by running &quot;gmake -f
        nwgnumakefile.&quot;&nbsp; You can create a distribution directory by
        adding an install parameter to the command (ex. gmake -f nwgnumakefile
        install).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Additional make options</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile - Builds release versions of all of the
        binaries and copies them to a \release destination directory.</li>
      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile DEBUG=1 - Builds debug versions of all of the
        binaries and copies them to a \debug destination directory.</li>
      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile install - Creates a complete Apache
        distribution with binaries, docs and additional support files in a

      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile installdev - Same as install but also creates a
        \lib and \include directory in the destination directory and copies
        headers and import files.</li>
      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile clean - Cleans all object files and binaries
        from the \release or \debug build areas depending on whether DEBUG has
        been defined.</li>
      <li>gmake -f nwgnumakefile clobber_all - Same as clean and also deletes
