<H1>Compiling Apache under UnixWare</H1>

To compile a working copy of Apache under UnixWare, there are several other
steps you may need to take. These prevent such problems as zombie processes,
bind errors, and accept errors, to name a few.

<H2>UnixWare 1.x</H2>

Make sure that USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZE_ACCEPT is defined (if not
defined by Apache autoconfiguration).

<H2>UnixWare 2.0.x</H2>

SCO patch <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/UW20/tf2163.txt">tf2163</a> is required
in order for Apache to work correctly on UnixWare 2.0.x. See
<a href="http://www.sco.com">http://www.sco.com</a>
for UnixWare patch information.<p>

In addition, make sure that USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZE_ACCEPT is defined (if not
defined by Apache autoconfiguration). To reduce instances of connections
in FIN_WAIT_2 state, you may also want to define NO_LINGCLOSE (Apache 1.2
only).

<H2>UnixWare 2.1.x</H2>

SCO patch <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/UW21/ptf3123b.txt">ptf3123</a> is required
in order for Apache to work correctly on UnixWare 2.1.x. See
<a href="http://www.sco.com">http://www.sco.com</a>
for UnixWare patche information.<p>

In addition, make sure that USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZE_ACCEPT is defined (if not
defined by Apache autoconfiguration). To reduce instances of connections
in FIN_WAIT_2 state, you may also want to define NO_LINGCLOSE (Apache 1.2
only).<p>
