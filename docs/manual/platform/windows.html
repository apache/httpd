    <h1 align="CENTER">Using Apache with Microsoft Windows</h1>

    <p>This document explains how to install, configure and run
    Apache 2.0 under Microsoft Windows. If you find any bugs, or
    wish to contribute in other ways, please use our <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/bugs/">bug reporting page.</a></p>

    <p>Most of this document assumes that you are installing
    Windows from a binary distribution. If you want to compile
    Apache yourself (possibly to help with development, or to track
    down bugs), see <a href="win_compiling.html">Compiling Apache
    for Microsoft Windows</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>At this time, support for Windows 95, 98 and ME is
    incomplete. Apache 2.0 is not expected to work on those
    platforms at this time.</strong> If you are interested in
    helping with that effort, please see the developer's site for
    information on <a href="http://dev.apache.org/">how to get
    involved</a>. Support will likely be provided at some point in
    the future, and patches to allow Apache to work on 95, 98 and
    ME are welcome!</p>

    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>

    <p>Apache 2.0 is designed to run on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
    2000. The binary installer will only work with the x86 family
    of processors, such as Intel's. Apache may also run on Windows
    95, 98 and ME, but these are not tested, and are never
    recommended for production servers. In all cases TCP/IP
    networking must be installed.</p>

    <p>If running on Windows 95, the "Winsock2" upgrade MUST BE
    INSTALLED. "Winsock2" for Windows 95 is available <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>If running on NT 4.0, installing Service Pack 3 or 6 is
    recommended, as Service Pack 4 created known issues with TCP/IP
    and WinSock integrity that were resolved in later Service
    Packs.</p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on
    the Apache web server at <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a>.
    This will list the current release, any more recent alpha or
    beta-test releases, together with details of mirror web and
    anonymous ftp sites.</p>

    <p>You should download the version of Apache for Windows with
    the <code>.msi</code> extension. This is a single Microsoft
    Installer file containing Apache, ready to install and run.
    There is a seperate <code>.zip</code> file containing _only_
    the source code, to compile Apache yourself with the Microsoft
    Visual C++ (Visual Studio) tools.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Installing Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Run the Apache <samp>.msi</samp> file you downloaded above.
    This will ask for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the directory to install Apache into (the default is
      <code>\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache</code> although you
      can change this to any other directory)</li>

      <li>the start menu name (default is "Apache Web Server")</li>

      <li>the installation type. The "Typical" option installs
      everything except the source code. The "Minimum" option does
      not install the manuals or source code. Choose the "Custom"
      install if you want to install the source code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During the installation, Apache will configure the files in
    the <samp>conf</samp> directory for your chosen installation
    directory. However if any of the files in this directory
    already exist they will <strong>not</strong> be overwritten.
    Instead the new copy of the corresponding file will be left
    with the extension <samp>.default</samp>. So, for example, if
    <samp>conf\httpd.conf</samp> already exists it will not be
    altered, but the version which would have been installed will
    be left in <samp>conf\httpd.conf.default</samp>. After the
    installation has finished you should manually check to see what
    in new in the <samp>.default</samp> file, and if necessary
    update your existing configuration files.</p>

    <p>Also, if you already have a file called
    <samp>htdocs\index.html</samp> then it will not be overwritten
    (no <samp>index.html.default</samp> file will be installed
    either). This should mean it a safe to install Apache over an
    existing installation (but you will have to stop the existing
    server running before doing the installation, then start the
    new one after the installation is finished).</p>

    <p>After installing Apache, you should edit the configuration
    files in the <samp>conf</samp> directory as required. These
    files will be configured during the install ready for Apache to
    be run from the directory where it was installed, with the
    documents served from the subdirectory <samp>htdocs</samp>.
    There are lots of other options which should be set before you
    start really using Apache. However to get started quickly the
    files should work as installed.</p>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for Windows</a></h2>
    There are two ways you can run Apache: 

    <ul>
      <li>As a <a href="win_service.html#service">"service"</a>
      (available on Windows NT/2000, or a pseudo-service on Windows
      95, 98 or ME). This is the best option if you want Apache to
      automatically start when you machine boots, and to keep
      Apache running when you log-off.</li>

      <li>From a <a href="#cmdline">console window</a>. This MUST
      be used by any administrator to test before to attempting to
      run as a service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To run Apache from a console window, select the "Start
    Apache as console app" option from the Start menu (in Apache
    1.3.4 and earlier, this option was called "Apache Server").
    This will open a console window and start Apache running inside
    it. The window will remain active until you stop Apache. To
    stop Apache running, either select the "Shutdown Apache console
    app" icon option from the Start menu (this is not available in
    Apache 1.3.4 or earlier), or see <a href="#signal">Signalling
    Console Apache when Running</a> for how to control Apache from
    the command line.</p>

    <p>If the Apache console window closes immediately (or
    unexpectedly), run the "Command Prompt" from the Start Menu -
    Programs list. Change to the folder to which you installed
    Apache, type the command apache, and read the error message.
    Then change to the logs folder, and review the error.log file
    for configuration mistakes. If you accepted the defaults when
    you installed Apache, the commands would be:</p>
<pre>
  c:
  cd "\program files\apache group\apache"
  apache
  <samp>Wait for Apache to exit, or press Ctrl+C</samp>
  cd logs
  more &lt;error.log
</pre>

    <p><strong>Complete the steps above before you proceed to
    attempt to start Apache as a Window NT/2000
    service!</strong></p>

    <p>To start Apache as a service, you first need to install it
    as a service. Multiple Apache services can be installed, each
    with a different name and configuration. To install the default
    Apache service named "Apache", run the "Install Apache as
    Service (NT only)" option from the Start menu. Once this is
    done you can start the "Apache" service by opening the Services
    window (in the Control Panel), selecting Apache, then clicking
    on Start. Apache will now be running in the background. You can
    later stop Apache by clicking on Stop. As an alternative to
    using the Services window, you can start and stop the "Apache"
    service from the control line with:</p>
<pre>
  NET START APACHE
  NET STOP APACHE
</pre>

    <p>See <a href="#signalsrv">Signalling Service Apache when
    Running</a> for more information on installing and controlling
    Apache services.</p>

    <p><strong>Apache, unlike many other Windows NT/2000 services,
    logs any errors to it's own error.log file in the logs folder
    within the Apache server root folder. You will <em>not</em>
    find Apache error details in the Windows NT Event
    Log.</strong></p>

    <p>After starting Apache running (either in a console window or
    as a service) if will be listening to port 80 (unless you
    changed the <samp>Listen</samp> directive in the configuration
    files). To connect to the server and access the default page,
    launch a browser and enter this URL:</p>
<pre>
  http://localhost/
</pre>

    <p>This should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the
    Apache manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in
    the <samp>error_log</samp> file in the <samp>logs</samp>
    directory. If your host isn't connected to the net, you may
    have to use this URL:</p>
<pre>
  http://127.0.0.1/
</pre>

    <p>Once your basic installation is working, you should
    configure it properly by editing the files in the
    <samp>conf</samp> directory. Again, if you change the
    configuration of the Windows NT/2000 service for Apache, first
    attempt to start it from the command line to assure that the
    service starts with no errors.</p>

    <p>Because Apache <em>CANNOT</em> share the same port with
    another TCPIP application, you may need to stop or uninstall
    certain services first. These include (but are not limited to)
    other web servers, and firewall products such as BlackIce. If
    you can only start Apache with these services disabled,
    reconfigure either Apache or the other product so that they do
    not listen on the same TCPIP ports.</p>

    <h2><a id="use" name="use">Configuring Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Apache is configured by files in the <samp>conf</samp>
    directory. These are the same as files used to configure the
    Unix version, but there are a few different directives for
    Apache on Windows. See the <a href="../">Apache
    documentation</a> for all the available directives.</p>

    <p>The main differences in Apache for Windows are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Because Apache for Windows is multithreaded, it does not
        use a separate process for each request, as Apache does
        with Unix. Instead there are usually only two Apache
        processes running: a parent process, and a child which
        handles the requests. Within the child each request is
        handled by a separate thread.</p>

        <p>So the "process"-management directives are
        different:</p>

        <p><a
        href="../mod/mpm_common.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</a>
        - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests
        a process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix,
        a process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so
        if this is set, it is recommended that a very high number
        is used. The recommended default, <code>MaxRequestsPerChild
        0</code>, does not cause the process to ever exit.
        <strong>Warning: The server configuration file is reread
        when the new child process is started. If you have modified
        httpd.conf, the new child may not start or you may receive
        unexpected results.</strong></p>

        <p><a
        href="../mod/mpm_common.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a>
        - This directive is new, and tells the server how many
        threads it should use. This is the maximum number of
        connections the server can handle at once; be sure and set
        this number high enough for your site if you get a lot of
        hits. The recommended default is <code>ThreadsPerChild
        50</code>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now
        must use Windows filenames instead of Unix ones. However,
        because Apache uses Unix-style names internally, you must
        use forward slashes, not backslashes. Drive letters can be
        used; if omitted, the drive with the Apache executable will
        be assumed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache for Windows contains the ability to load modules
        at runtime, without recompiling the server. If Apache is
        compiled normally, it will install a number of optional
        modules in the <code>\Apache\modules</code> directory. To
        activate these, or other modules, the new <a
        href="../mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a>
        directive must be used. For example, to active the status
        module, use the following (in addition to the
        status-activating directives in
        <code>access.conf</code>):</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
</pre>

        <p>Information on <a
        href="../mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
        modules</a> is also available.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache can also load ISAPI Extensions (<em>i.e.</em>,
        Internet Server Applications), such as those used by
        Microsoft's IIS, and other Windows servers. <a
        href="../mod/mod_isapi.html">More information is
        available.</a> Note that Apache <em>CANNOT</em> load ISAPI
        Filters.</p>
      </li>

      <li>When running CGI scripts, the method Apache uses to find
      the interpreter for the script is configurable using the <a
      href="../mod/core.html#scriptinterpretersource">ScriptInterpreterSource</a>
      directive.</li>

      <li>Since it is often difficult to manage files with names
      like <code>.htaccess</code> under windows, you may find it
      useful to change the name of this configuration file using
      the <a
      href="../mod/core.html#accessfilename">AccessFilename</a>
      directive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="service" name="service">Running Apache for Windows
    as a Service</a></h2>

    <p><strong>Note: The -n option to specify a service name is
    only available with Apache 1.3.7 and later. Earlier versions of
    Apache only support the default service name
    'Apache'.</strong></p>

    <p>You can install Apache as a Windows NT service as
    follows:</p>
<pre>
    apache -k install -n "service name"
</pre>

    <p>To install a service to use a particular configuration,
    specify the configuration file when the service is
    installed:</p>
<pre>
    apache -k install -n "service name" -f "\my server\conf\my.conf"
</pre>

    <p>To remove an Apache service, use</p>
<pre>
    apache -k uninstall -n "service name"
</pre>

    <p>The default "service name", if one is not specified, is
    "Apache".</p>

    <p>Once a service is installed, you can use the <samp>-n</samp>
    option, in conjunction with other options, to refer to a
    service's configuration file. For example:</p>

    <p>To test a service's configuration file:</p>
<pre>
    apache -n "service name" -t
</pre>

    <p>To start a console Apache using a service's configuration
    file:</p>
<pre>
    apache -n "service name"
</pre>

    <p><strong>Important Note on service dependencies:</strong></p>

    <p>Prior to Apache release 1.3.13, the dependencies required to
    successfully start an installed service were not configured.
    After installing a service using earlier versions of Apache,
    you must follow these steps:</p>
<pre>
    Run regedt32
    Select <u>W</u>indow - "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine" from the menu
    Double-click to open the SYSTEM, then the CurrentControlSet keys
    Scroll down and click on the Apache servicename
    Select <u>E</u>dit - Add <u>V</u>alue... from the menu
    Fill in the Add Value dialog with 
        <u>V</u>alue Name: DependOnGroup 
        <u>D</u>ata Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
        and click OK
    Leave the Multi-String Editor dialog empty and click OK
    Select <u>E</u>dit - Add <u>V</u>alue... from the menu
    Fill in the Add Value dialog with 
        <u>V</u>alue Name: DependOnService
        <u>D</u>ata Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
        and click OK
    Type the following list (one per line) in the Multi-String Editor dialog
        Tcpip
        Afd
        and click OK
</pre>

    <p>If you are using COM or DCOM components from a third party
    module, ISAPI, or other add-in scripting technologies such as
    ActiveState Perl, you may also need to add the entry Rpcss to
    the DependOnService list. To avoid exposing the TCP port 135
    when it is unnecessary, Apache does not create that entry upon
    installation. Follow the directions above to find or create the
    DependOnService value, double click that value if it already
    exists, and add the Rpcss entry to the list.</p>

    <h2><a id="cmdline" name="cmdline">Running Apache for Windows
    from the Command Line</a></h2>

    <p>The Start menu icons and the NT Service manager can provide
    a simple interface for administering Apache. But in some cases
    it is easier to work from the command line.</p>

    <p>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will
    find the configuration files. You can specify a configuration
    file on the command line in two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration
      file</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -f "c:\my server\conf\my.conf"
    apache -f test\test.conf
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>-n specifies the configuration file of an installed
      Apache service (Apache 1.3.7 and later)</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -n "service name"
</pre>

    <p>In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the
    configuration file.</p>

    <p>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f or
    -n, Apache will use the file name compiled into the server,
    usually "conf/httpd.conf". Invoking Apache with the -V switch
    will display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Apache
    will then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in
    this order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.</li>

      <li>The -d switch on the command line.</li>

      <li>Current working directory</li>

      <li>A registry entry, created if you did a binary
      install.</li>

      <li>The server root compiled into the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The server root compiled into the server is usually
    "/apache". invoking apache with the -V switch will display this
    value labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</p>

    <p>When invoked from the start menu, Apache is usually passed
    no arguments, so using the registry entry is the preferred
    technique for console Apache.</p>

    <p>During a binary installation, a version-specific registry
    key is created in the Windows registry:</p>
<pre>
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apache Group\Apache\1.3.7

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apache Group\Apache\2.0a3
</pre>

    <p>This key is compiled into the server and can enable you to
    test new versions without affecting the current version. Of
    course you must take care not to install the new version on top
    of the old version in the file system.</p>

    <p>If you did not do a binary install then Apache will in some
    scenarios complain that about the missing registry key. This
    warning can be ignored if it otherwise was able to find its
    configuration files.</p>

    <p>The value of this key is the "ServerRoot" directory,
    containing the <samp>conf</samp> directory. When Apache starts
    it will read the <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file from this
    directory. If this file contains a <samp>ServerRoot</samp>
    directive which is different from the directory obtained from
    the registry key above, Apache will forget the registry key and
    use the directory from the configuration file. If you copy the
    Apache directory or configuration files to a new location it is
    vital that you update the <samp>ServerRoot</samp> directory in
    the <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file to the new location.</p>

    <p>To run Apache from the command line as a console
    application, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
    apache 
</pre>

    <p>Apache will execute, and will remain running until it is
    stopped by pressing control-C.</p>

    <h2><a id="signalsrv" name="signalsrv">Signalling Service
    Apache when running</a></h2>

    <p>On Windows NT, multiple instances of Apache can be run as
    services. Signal an Apache service to start, restart, or
    shutdown as follows:</p>
<pre>
    apache -n "service name" -k start
    apache -n "service name" -k restart
    apache -n "service name" -k shutdown
</pre>

    <p>In addition, you can use the native NT NET command to start
    and stop Apache services as follows:</p>
<pre>
    NET START "service name"
    NET STOP "service name"
</pre>

    <h2><a id="signal" name="signal">Signalling Console Apache when
    running</a></h2>

    <p>On Windows 95, Apache runs as a console application. You can
    tell a running Apache to stop by opening another console window
    and typing:</p>
<pre>
    apache -k shutdown
</pre>

    <p>This should be used instead of pressing Control-C in the
    running Apache console window, because it lets Apache end any
    current transactions and cleanup gracefully.</p>

    <p>You can also tell Apache to restart. This makes it re-read
    the configuration files. Any transactions in progress are
    allowed to complete without interruption. To restart Apache,
    run</p>
<pre>
    apache -k restart
</pre>

    <p>Note for people familiar with the Unix version of Apache:
    these commands provide a Windows equivalent to <code>kill -TERM
    <em>pid</em></code> and <code>kill -USR1 <em>pid</em></code>.
    The command line option used, <code>-k</code>, was chosen as a
    reminder of the "kill" command used on Unix.</p>
