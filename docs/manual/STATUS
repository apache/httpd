Apache HTTP Server 2.0 Documentation Status File.

If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Ryan <rbb@covalent.net> offers to supply information
                on the operation of each MPM.  There is also some info in
                htdocs/manual/mpm.html that will need to be cleaned up,
                linked up, and updated.
                Joshua <slive@finance.commerce.ubc.ca> has committed
                an intitial version of mpmt_pthread for discussion.

- Merging of changes in 1.3.
   - There have been many changes in the 1.3 docs which haven't
     been propagated into 2.0.  For example, many of the "It Worked"
     translations have not made it.
     Things which need to be merged:
         manual/howto/*

- Reorganizing.
   - Joshua thinks this is a good opportunity to think about directory
     structure.  
       Proposal:
         Create manual/FAQ which contains all the manual/misc/FAQ* docs
         Create manual/platform which contans
             manual/windows.html
             manual/win_compiling.html
             manual/readme-tpf.html
             manual/unixware.html
             manual/misc/perf-*.html

- Cleaning.
   - We could use a list of all the docs that can be axed out of 2.0
     because they are redundant or irrelevant.
        Status: Rich <rbowen@rcbowen.com> is going to look at this.
	Some suggestions on files to axe.  Feel free to comment.
          manual/bind.html (mostly now documented in server-wide.html)
          manual/cgi-path.html (should be documented in mod_cgi.html instead)
          manual/multi-logs.html (documented in mod_log_config.html)
          manual/process-model.html (documented in MPMs, eventually)
          manual/mod/index-bytype.html

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup.  For example,
     manual/invoking.html could use a big cleanup with lots of the
     "this changed in 1.3.10" stuff removed.


- New build process.
   - The new build process is autoconf based, so manual/install.html
     will need to be completely rewritten.  Someone with enough
     patience could probably figure out most of the important stuff
     by trial and error.
        Status: Ryan's "Building and Installing Apache 2.0" might be
                a starting place.  Rich <rbowen@rcbown.com> is interested
                in collaborating with someone else on this.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.
        Status: Ryan has two ApacheToday articles which may be useful 
                for this.

- Translations
        Status: ???


- The STATUS Document.
   - Is this the best organization/format?  What else needs to be
     added?  Should this be auto-posted to apache-docs?
