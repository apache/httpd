<title>Upgrading to 2.4 from 2.2</title>

<summary>
  <p>In order to assist folks upgrading, we maintain a document
  describing information critical to existing Apache HTTP Server users. These
  are intended to be brief notes, and you should be able to find
  more information in either the <a
  href="new_features_2_4.html">New Features</a> document, or in
  the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file.</p>

  <p>This document describes only the changes from 2.2 to 2.4.  If you
  are upgrading from version 2.0, you should also consult the <a
  href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/upgrading.html">2.0 to 2.2
