      <p>Welcome to mod_rewrite, the Swiss Army Knife of URL
      manipulation!</p>

      <p>This module uses a rule-based rewriting engine (based on a
      regular-expression parser) to rewrite requested URLs on the
      fly. It supports an unlimited number of rules and an
      unlimited number of attached rule conditions for each rule to
      provide a really flexible and powerful URL manipulation
      mechanism. The URL manipulations can depend on various tests,
      for instance server variables, environment variables, HTTP
      headers, time stamps and even external database lookups in
      various formats can be used to achieve granular URL
      matching.</p>

      <p>This module operates on the full URLs (including the
      path-info part) both in per-server context
      (<code>httpd.conf</code>) and per-directory context
      (<code>.htaccess</code>) and can even generate query-string
      parts on result. The rewritten result can lead to internal
      sub-processing, external request redirection or even to an
      internal proxy throughput.</p>

      <p>But all this functionality and flexibility has its
      drawback: complexity. So don't expect to understand this
      entire module in just one day.</p>
