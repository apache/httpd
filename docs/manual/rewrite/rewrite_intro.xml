  <title>Apache mod_rewrite Introduction</title>

<summary>
<p>This document supplements the <module>mod_rewrite</module>
<a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It
describes the basic concepts necessary for use of
<module>mod_rewrite</module>. Other documents go into greater detail,
but this doc should help the beginner get their feet wet.

<section id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Apache module <module>mod_rewrite</module> is a very powerful and
sophisticated module which provides a way to do URL manipulations. With
it, you can do nearly all types of URL rewriting that you may need. It
is, however, somewhat complex, and may be intimidating to the beginner.
There is also a tendency to treat rewrite rules as magic incantation,
using them without actually understanding what they do.</p>

<p>This document attempts to give sufficient background so that what
follows is understood, rather than just copied blindly.
</p>
</section>

<section id="regex"><title>Regular Expressions</title>

<p>mod_rewrite uses the <a href="http://pcre.org/">Perl Compatible
Regular Expression</a> vocabulary. In this document, we do not attempt
to provide a detailed reference to regular expressions. For that, we
recommend the <a href="http://pcre.org/pcre.txt">PCRE man pages</a>, the
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlre.html">Perl regular
expression man page</a>, and <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex2/index.html">Mastering
Regular Expressions, by Jeffrey Friedl</a>.</p>

<p>In this document, we attempt to provide enough of a regex vocabulary
to get you started, without being overwhelming, in the hope that
<directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive>s will be scientific
formulae, rather than magical incantations.</p>

<section id="regexvocab"><title>Regex vocabulary</title>

<p>The following are the minimal building blocks you will need, in order
to write regular expressions and <directive
module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive>s.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>.</code></td><td>Matches any character</td></tr>

</table>

</section>

<section id="InternalBackRefs"><title>Regex Back-Reference Availability</title>

      <p>One important thing here has to be remembered: Whenever you
      use parentheses in <em>Pattern</em> or in one of the
      <em>CondPattern</em>, back-references are internally created
      which can be used with the strings <code>$N</code> and
      <code>%N</code> (see below). These are available for creating
      the strings <em>Substitution</em> and <em>TestString</em>.
      Figure 2 shows to which locations the back-references are
      transferred for expansion.</p>

<section id="rewriterule"><title>RewriteRule basics</title>
<p>
Basic anatomy of a RewriteRule, with exhaustively annotated simple
examples.
</p>
</section>

<section id="flags"><title>Rewrite Flags</title>
<p>Discussion of the flags to RewriteRule, and when and why one might
use them.</p>
</section>

<section id="rewritecond"><title>Rewrite conditions</title>
<p>Discussion of RewriteCond, looping, and other related concepts.
</p>
</section>

<section id="rewritemap"><title>Rewrite maps</title>
<p>Discussion of RewriteMap, including simple, but heavily annotated,
examples.</p>
</section>

<section id="htaccess"><title>.htaccess files</title>
<p>Discussion of the differences between rewrite rules in httpd.conf and
in .htaccess files.</p>
</section>

<section id="EnvVar"><title>Environment Variables</title>

<p>This module keeps track of two additional (non-standard)
CGI/SSI environment variables named <code>SCRIPT_URL</code>
and <code>SCRIPT_URI</code>. These contain the
<em>logical</em> Web-view to the current resource, while the
standard CGI/SSI variables <code>SCRIPT_NAME</code> and
<code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> contain the <em>physical</em>
System-view. </p>

<p>Notice: These variables hold the URI/URL <em>as they were
initially requested</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, <em>before</em> any
rewriting. This is important because the rewriting process is
primarily used to rewrite logical URLs to physical
pathnames.</p>

<example><title>Example</title>
<pre>
SCRIPT_NAME=/sw/lib/w3s/tree/global/u/rse/.www/index.html
SCRIPT_FILENAME=/u/rse/.www/index.html
SCRIPT_URL=/u/rse/
SCRIPT_URI=http://en1.engelschall.com/u/rse/
