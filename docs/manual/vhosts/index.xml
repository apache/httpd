   <title>Apache Virtual Host documentation</title>

<summary>

    <p>The term <cite>Virtual Host</cite> refers to the practice of
    running more than one web site (such as
    <code>company1.example.com</code> and <code>company2.example.com</code>)
    on a single machine. Virtual hosts can be "<a
    href="ip-based.html">IP-based</a>", meaning that you have a
    different IP address for every web site, or "<a
    href="name-based.html">name-based</a>", meaning that you have
    multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they
    are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the
    end user.</p>

    <p>Apache was one of the first servers to support IP-based
    virtual hosts right out of the box. Versions 1.1 and later of
    Apache support both IP-based and name-based virtual hosts
    (vhosts). The latter variant of virtual hosts is sometimes also
    called <em>host-based</em> or <em>non-IP virtual hosts</em>.</p>

    <p>Below is a list of documentation pages which explain all
    details of virtual host support in Apache HTTP Server:</p>

<section id="directives"><title>Configuration directives</title>

    <ul>
      <li><directive type="section"
           module="core">VirtualHost</directive></li>
      <li><directive module="core">ServerName</directive></li>
      <li><directive module="core">ServerAlias</directive></li>
      <li><directive module="core">ServerPath</directive></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are trying to debug your virtual host configuration, you
    may find the Apache <code>-S</code> command line switch
    useful. That is, type the following command:</p>

    <example>
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -S
    </example>

    <p>This command will dump out a description of how Apache parsed
    the configuration file. Careful examination of the IP addresses and
    server names may help uncover configuration mistakes. (See
    the docs for the <program>httpd</program> program for
    other command line options)</p>
