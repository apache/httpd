<p>This module associates the request filename's extensions (e.g. .html) with
the file's behavior (handlers and filters) and content (mime-type, language,
character set and encoding.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This module is used to associate various bits of "meta information" with
files by their filename extensions. This information relates the filename
of the document to it's mime-type, language, character set and encoding.
This information is sent to the browser, and participates in content 
negotiation, so the user's preferences are respected when choosing one of 
several possible files to serve.  See 
<a href="mod_negotiation">mod_negotiation</a> for more information about
content negotation.

<P>

The directives <a href="#addhandler">AddHandler</a>, 
<a href="#addoutputfilter">AddOutputFilter</a>, and
<a href="#addinputfilter">AddInputFilter</a> control the modules or
scripts that serve the document.

<P>

In addition, mod_mime may define the "handler" for a document, which controls
which module or script will serve the document.  With the introduction of
"filters" in Apache 2.0, mod_mime can also define the filters that the 
the content should be processed through (e.g. the Includes output filter for
server side scripting) and what filters the client request and POST content 
should be processed through (the input filters.)

<P>

The directives <a href="#addcharset">AddCharset</a>,
<a href="#addencoding">AddEncoding</a>, <a href="#addlanguage">AddLanguage</a> 
and <a href="#addtype">AddType</a> are all used to map file extensions onto 
the meta-information for that file.  Respectively they set the character set, 
content-encoding, content-language, and MIME-type (content-type) of documents.

<P>

The directive <a href="#typesconfig">TypesConfig</a> is used to specify a
file which also maps extensions onto MIME types.  Most administrators use
the provided mime.types file which associates common filename extensions
with IANA registered content types.  The current list is maintained at
<code>http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types</code>
although it may be mirrored elsewhere).  This simplifies the httpd.conf file
by providing the majority of media-type definitions, and they may be
overriden by <a href="#addtype">AddType</a> directives as needed.

<P>

<EM>Please do not send requests to the Apache httpd Project to add any new
entries in the distributed mime.types file unless (1) they are already 
registered with IANA, and (2) they use widely accepted, non-conflicting
filename extensions across platforms.  category/x-subtype requests will
be automatically rejected, as will any new two-letter extensions as they
will likely conflict later with the already crowded language and character 
set namespace.</EM>

<P>

The core directives <a href="core.html#forcetype">ForceType</a> and 
<a href="core.html#sethandler">SetHandler</a> are used to associate
all the files in a given container (<em>e.g.</em>, &lt;location&gt;, 
&lt;directory&gt;, or &lt;Files&gt;) with a particular MIME-type or 
handler.  These settings override any filename extension mappings 
defined in mod_mime.

<P>

Note that changing the type or encoding of a file does not change the
value of the <CODE>Last-Modified</code> header. Thus, previously cached
copies may still be used by a client or proxy, with the previous headers.
If you change the meta-information (language, content type, character set
or encoding) you may need to 'touch' affected files (updating their last 
modified date) to ensure that all visitors are receive the corrected 
content headers.

<h2><a name="multipleext">Files with Multiple Extensions</a></h2>

Files can have more than one extension, and the order of the
extensions is <em>normally</em> irrelevant. For example, if the file
<code>welcome.html.fr</code> maps onto content type text/html and
language French then the file <code>welcome.fr.html</code> will map
onto exactly the same information. The only exception to this is if an
extension is given which Apache does not know how to handle. In this
case it will "forget" about any information it obtained from
extensions to the left of the unknown extension. So, for example, if
the extensions fr and html are mapped to the appropriate language and
type but extension xxx is not assigned to anything, then the file
<code>welcome.fr.xxx.html</code> will be associated with content-type
text/html but <em>no</em> language.

<P>

If more than one extension is given which maps onto the same type of
meta-information, then the one to the right will be used. For example,
if ".gif" maps to the MIME-type image/gif and ".html" maps to the
MIME-type text/html, then the file <code>welcome.gif.html</code> will
be associated with the MIME-type "text/html".

<P>

Care should be taken when a file with multiple extensions gets
associated with both a MIME-type and a handler. This will usually
result in the request being by the module associated with the
handler. For example, if the <code>.imap</code> extension is mapped to
the handler "imap-file" (from mod_imap) and the <code>.html</code>
extension is mapped to the MIME-type "text/html", then the file
<code>world.imap.html</code> will be associated with both the
"imap-file" handler and "text/html" MIME-type. When it is processed,
the "imap-file" handler will be used, and so it will be treated as a
mod_imap imagemap file.

<h2><a name="contentencoding">Content encoding</a></h2>

A file of a particular MIME type can additionally be encoded a
particular way to simplify transmission over the Internet. While this
usually will refer to compression, such as <samp>gzip</samp>, it can 
also refer to encryption, such a <samp>pgp</samp> or
to an encoding such as UUencoding, which is designed for transmitting
a binary file in an ASCII (text) format.<p>

The MIME RFC puts it this way:
<blockquote>
The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content
coding has been applied to the resource, and thus what decoding mechanism
must be applied in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the
Content-Type header field. The Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow
a document to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying
media type.
</blockquote>

By using more than one file extension (see 
<a href="#multipleext">section above about multiple file 
extensions</a>), you can indicate that a file is of a particular 
<em>type</em>, and also has a particular <em>encoding</em>.<p>

For example, you may have a file which is a Microsoft Word document,
which is pkzipped to reduce its size. If the <samp>.doc</samp> extension is
associated with the Microsoft Word file type, and the
<samp>.zip</samp> extension is associated with the pkzip file
encoding, then the file <samp>Resume.doc.zip</samp>would be known to
be a pkzip'ed Word document.<p>

Apache send a <samp>Content-encoding</samp> header with the resource,
in order to tell the client browser about the encoding method.
<p>
<samp>Content-encoding: pkzip</samp>
<p>
<h2>Character sets and languages</h2>

Finally, in addition to file type, and the file encoding,
another important piece of information is
what language a particular document is in, and in what character set
the file should be displayed. For example, the document might be
written in the Vietnamese alphabet, or in Cyrillic, and should be
displayed as such. This information, also, is transmitted in HTTP
headers.<p>

While the character set is useful for the browser, in order to
determine how to display the document, the language and the
character set are also used in the process of content negotiation
(See <a href="mod_negotiation.html">mod_negotiation</a>)
to determine which document to give to the client, when there are
alternative documents in more than one language, or more than 
one character set.<p>

To convey this further information, Apache optionally sends a
<samp>Content-Language</samp> header, to specify the language that the
document is in, and can append additional information onto the
<samp>Content-Type</samp> header to indicate the particular character
set that should be used to correctly render the information.

<pre>
Content-Language: en, fr
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2
</pre>
<p>
The language specification is the two-letter abbreviation for the
language. The <samp>charset</samp> is the name of the particular
character set which should be used.</p>

<P>
The AddCharset directive maps the given filename extensions to the
specified content charset. <i>charset</i> is the MIME charset
parameter of filenames containing <i>extension</i>.  This mapping is
added to any already in force, overriding any mappings that already
exist for the same <i>extension</i>.
</P>
<P>
Example:
<pre>
    AddLanguage ja .ja
    AddCharset EUC-JP .euc
    AddCharset ISO-2022-JP .jis
    AddCharset SHIFT_JIS .sjis
</pre>

<P>
Then the document <code>xxxx.ja.jis</code> will be treated as being a
Japanese document whose charset is ISO-2022-JP (as will the document
<code>xxxx.jis.ja</code>). The AddCharset directive is useful for both
to inform the client about the character encoding of the document so
that the document can be interpreted and displayed appropriately, and
for <a href="../content-negotiation.html">content negotiation</a>, where
the server returns one from several documents based on the client's
charset preference.

The AddEncoding directive maps the given filename extensions to the
specified encoding type. <em>MIME-enc</em> is the MIME encoding to use
for documents containing the <em>extension</em>. This mapping is added
to any already in force, overriding any mappings that already exist
for the same <em>extension</em>.

Example:
<blockquote><code>
AddEncoding x-gzip .gz<br> 
AddEncoding x-compress .Z
</code></blockquote>

This will cause filenames containing the .gz extension to be marked as
encoded using the x-gzip encoding, and filenames containing the .Z
extension to be marked as encoded with x-compress.<P>

Old clients expect <code>x-gzip</code> and <code>x-compress</code>,
however the standard dictates that they're equivalent to <code>gzip</code>
and <code>compress</code> respectively.  Apache does content encoding
comparisons by ignoring any leading <code>x-</code>.  When responding
with an encoding Apache will use whatever form (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>x-foo</code>
or <code>foo</code>) the client requested.  If the client didn't
specifically request a particular form Apache will use the form given by
the <code>AddEncoding</code> directive.  To make this long story short,
you should always use <code>x-gzip</code> and <code>x-compress</code>
for these two specific encodings.  More recent encodings, such as
<code>deflate</code> should be specified without the <code>x-</code>.

<p>The <em>extension</em> argument is case-insensitive, and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.</p>

The DefaultLanguage directive tells Apache that all files in the
directive's scope (<em>e.g.</em>, all files covered by the current
<code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> container) that don't have an explicit
language extension (such as <samp>.fr</samp> or <samp>.de</samp> as
configured by <samp>AddLanguage</samp>) should be considered to be in
the specified <em>MIME-lang</em> language.  This allows entire
directories to be marked as containing Dutch content, for instance,
without having to rename each file. Note that unlike using extensions
to specify languages, <samp>DefaultLanguage</samp> can only specify a
single language.

<P>

If no <samp>DefaultLanguage</samp> directive is in force, and a file
does not have any language extensions as configured by
<samp>AddLanguage</samp>, then that file will be considered to have no
language attribute.

The <samp>RemoveHandler</samp> directive removes any
handler associations for files with the given extensions.
This allows <code>.htaccess</code> files in subdirectories to undo
any associations inherited from parent directories or the server
config files.  An example of its use might be:
</P>
<dl>
 <dt><code>/foo/.htaccess:</code></dt>
 <dd><code>AddHandler server-parsed .html</code></dd>
 <dt><code>/foo/bar/.htaccess:</code></dt>
 <dd><code>RemoveHandler .html</code></dd>
</dl>
<P>
This has the effect of returning <samp>.html</samp> files in the
<samp>/foo/bar</samp> directory to being treated as normal
files, rather than as candidates for parsing (see the
<a href="mod_include.html"><samp>mod_include</samp></a> module).

The TypesConfig directive sets the location of the MIME types configuration
file. <em>Filename</em> is relative to the
<a href="core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a>. This file sets the default list of
mappings from filename extensions to content types; changing this file is not
recommended. Use the <a href="#addtype">AddType</a> directive instead. The
file contains lines in the format of the arguments to an AddType command:
<blockquote><em>MIME-type extension extension ...</em></blockquote>
The extensions are lower-cased. Blank lines, and lines beginning with a hash
character (`#') are ignored.<P>
