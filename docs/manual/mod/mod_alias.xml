<summary>
    <p>The directives contained in this module allow for manipulation
    and control of URLs as requests arrive at the server. The
    <directive module="mod_alias">Alias</directive> and <directive
    module="mod_alias">ScriptAlias</directive> directives are used to
    map between URLs and filesystem paths.  This allows for content
    which is not directly under the <directive
    module="core">DocumentRoot</directive> served as part of the web
    document tree. The <directive
    module="mod_alias">ScriptAlias</directive> directive has the
    additional effect of marking the target directory as containing
    only CGI scripts.</p>

    <p>The <directive module="mod_alias">Redirect</directive>
    directives are used to instruct clients to make a new request with
    a different URL. They are often used when a resource has moved to
    a new location.</p>

    <p><module>mod_alias</module> is designed to handle simple URL
    manipulation tasks.  For more complicated tasks such as
    manipulating the query string, use the tools provided by
    <module>mod_rewrite</module>.</p>

<section id="order"><title>Order of Processing</title>

    <p>Aliases and Redirects occuring in different contexts are processed
    like other directives according to standard <a
    href="../sections.html#mergin">merging rules</a>.  But when multiple
    Aliases or Redirects occur in the same context (for example, in the
    same <directive type="section" module="core">VirtualHost</directive>
    section) they are processed in a particular order.</p>

    <p>First, all Redirects are processed before Aliases are processed,
    and therefore a request that matches a <directive
    module="mod_alias">Redirect</directive> or <directive
    module="mod_alias">RedirectMatch</directive> will never have Aliases
    applied.  Second, the Aliases and Redirects are processed in the order
    they appear in the configuration files, with the first match taking
    precedence.</p>

    <p>For this reason, when two or more of these directives apply to the
    same sub-path, you must list the most specific path first in order for
    all the directives to have an effect.  For example, the following
    configuration will work as expected:</p>

    <example>
    Alias /foo/bar /baz<br />
    Alias /foo /gaq
    </example>

    <p>But if the above two directives were reversed in order, the
    <code>/foo</code> <directive module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>
    would always match before the <code>/foo/bar</code> <directive
    module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>, so the latter directive would be
    ignored.</p>

<name>Alias</name>
<description>Maps URLs to filesystem locations</description>
<syntax>Alias <var>URL-path</var>
<var>file-path</var>|<var>directory-path</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>

    <p>The <directive>Alias</directive> directive allows documents to
    be stored in the local filesystem other than under the
    <directive module="core">DocumentRoot</directive>. URLs with a
    (%-decoded) path beginning with <var>url-path</var> will be mapped
    to local files beginning with <var>directory-path</var>.  The
    <var>url-path</var> is case-sensitive, even on case-insensitive
    file systems.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      Alias /image /ftp/pub/image
    </example>

    <p>A request for <code>http://myserver/image/foo.gif</code> would cause
    the server to return the file <code>/ftp/pub/image/foo.gif</code>.  Only
    complete path segments are matched, so the above alias would not match a
    request for <code>http://myserver/imagefoo.gif</code>.  For more complex
    matching using regular expressions, see the <directive module="mod_alias"
    >AliasMatch</directive> directive.</p>

    <p>Note that if you include a trailing / on the
    <var>url-path</var> then the server will require a trailing / in
    order to expand the alias. That is, if you use</p>

    <dl><dd><code>Alias /icons/ /usr/local/apache/icons/</code></dd></dl>

    <p>then the url <code>/icons</code> will not be aliased.</p>

    <p>Note that you may need to specify additional <directive
    type="section" module="core">Directory</directive> sections which
    cover the <em>destination</em> of aliases.  Aliasing occurs before
    <directive type="section" module="core">Directory</directive> sections
    are checked, so only the destination of aliases are affected.
    (Note however <directive type="section" module="core">Location</directive>
    sections are run through once before aliases are performed, so
    they will apply.)</p>

    <p>In particular, if you are creating an <code>Alias</code> to a
    directory outside of your <directive
    module="core">DocumentRoot</directive>, you may need to explicitly
    permit access to the target directory.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
        Alias /image /ftp/pub/image<br />
        &lt;Directory /ftp/pub/image&gt;<br />
        <indent>
            Order allow,deny<br />
            Allow from all<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Directory&gt;

<name>AliasMatch</name>
<description>Maps URLs to filesystem locations using regular

<syntax>AliasMatch <var>regex</var>
<var>file-path</var>|<var>directory-path</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive is equivalent to <directive
    module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>, but makes use of
    <glossary ref="regex">regular expressions</glossary>,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path, and
    if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to activate the <code>/icons</code> directory, one might
    use:</p>

    <example>
      AliasMatch ^/icons(.*) /usr/local/apache/icons$1
    </example>

    <p>It is also possible to construct an alias with case-insensitive
    matching of the url-path:</p>

    <example>
      AliasMatch (?i)^/image(.*) /ftp/pub/image$1
    </example>

<name>Redirect</name>
<description>Sends an external redirect asking the client to fetch
a different URL</description>
<syntax>Redirect [<var>status</var>] <var>URL-path</var>
<var>URL</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>
    <p>The Redirect directive maps an old URL into a new one by asking
    the client to refetch the resource at the new location.</p>

    <p>The old <em>URL-path</em> is a case-sensitive (%-decoded) path
    beginning with a slash.  A relative path is not allowed.</p>
    
    <p>The new <em>URL</em> may be either an absolute URL beginning 
    with a scheme and hostname, or a URL-path beginning with a slash.
    In this latter case the scheme and hostname of the current server will
    be added.</p>

    <p>Then any request beginning with <em>URL-Path</em> will return a
    redirect request to the client at the location of the target
    <em>URL</em>.  Additional path information beyond the matched
    <em>URL-Path</em> will be appended to the target URL.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      Redirect /service http://foo2.example.com/service<br />
      <br />
      # Redirect to a URL on the same host<br />
      Redirect /one /two
    </example>

    <p>If the client requests <code>http://example.com/service/foo.txt</code>,
    it will be told to access
    <code>http://foo2.example.com/service/foo.txt</code>
    instead.  Only complete path segments are matched, so the above
    example would not match a request for
    <code>http://example.com/servicefoo.txt</code>.  For more complex matching
    using regular expressions, see the <directive
    module="mod_alias">RedirectMatch</directive> directive.</p>


    <note><title>Note</title>
    <p>Redirect directives take precedence over Alias and ScriptAlias
    directives, irrespective of their ordering in the configuration
    file.</p></note>

    <p>If no <var>status</var> argument is given, the redirect will
    be "temporary" (HTTP status 302). This indicates to the client
    that the resource has moved temporarily. The <var>status</var>
    argument can be used to return other HTTP status codes:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>permanent</dt>

      <dd>Returns a permanent redirect status (301) indicating that
      the resource has moved permanently.</dd>

      <dt>temp</dt>

      <dd>Returns a temporary redirect status (302). This is the
      default.</dd>

      <dt>seeother</dt>

      <dd>Returns a "See Other" status (303) indicating that the
      resource has been replaced.</dd>

      <dt>gone</dt>

      <dd>Returns a "Gone" status (410) indicating that the
      resource has been permanently removed. When this status is
      used the <var>URL</var> argument should be omitted.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Other status codes can be returned by giving the numeric
    status code as the value of <var>status</var>. If the status is
    between 300 and 399, the <var>URL</var> argument must be present,
    otherwise it must be omitted. Note that the status must be
    known to the Apache code (see the function
    <code>send_error_response</code> in http_protocol.c).</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      Redirect permanent /one http://example.com/two<br />
      Redirect 303 /three http://example.com/other

<name>ScriptAlias</name>
<description>Maps a URL to a filesystem location and designates the

<syntax>ScriptAlias <var>URL-path</var>
<var>file-path</var>|<var>directory-path</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>ScriptAlias</directive> directive has the same
    behavior as the <directive module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>
    directive, except that in addition it marks the target directory
    as containing CGI scripts that will be processed by <module
    >mod_cgi</module>'s cgi-script handler. URLs with a case-sensitive
    (%-decoded) path beginning with <var>URL-path</var> will be mapped
    to scripts beginning with the second argument, which is a full
    pathname in the local filesystem.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-bin/
    </example>

    <p>A request for <code>http://myserver/cgi-bin/foo</code> would cause the
    server to run the script <code>/web/cgi-bin/foo</code>.  This configuration
    is essentially equivalent to:</p>
    <example>
      Alias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-bin/<br />
      &lt;Location /cgi-bin &gt;<br />
      <indent>
      SetHandler cgi-script<br />
      Options +ExecCGI<br />
      </indent>
      &lt;/Location&gt;
    </example>

	<p><directive>ScriptAlias</directive> can also be used in conjunction with
	a script or handler you have. For example:</p>
	
	<example>
	  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-handler.pl
    </example>
    
    <p>In this scenario all files requested in <code>/cgi-bin/</code> will be
    handled by the file you have configured, this allows you to use your own custom 
    handler.  You may want to use this as a wrapper for CGI so that you can add 
    content, or some other bespoke action.</p>

    <note type="warning">It is safer to avoid placing CGI scripts under the
    <directive module="core">DocumentRoot</directive> in order to
    avoid accidentally revealing their source code if the
    configuration is ever changed.  The
    <directive>ScriptAlias</directive> makes this easy by mapping a
    URL and designating CGI scripts at the same time.  If you do
    choose to place your CGI scripts in a directory already
    accessible from the web, do not use
    <directive>ScriptAlias</directive>.  Instead, use <directive
    module="core" type="section">Directory</directive>, <directive
    module="core">SetHandler</directive>, and <directive
    module="core">Options</directive> as in:
    <example>
      &lt;Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/cgi-bin &gt;<br />
      <indent>
      SetHandler cgi-script<br />
      Options ExecCGI<br />
      </indent>
      &lt;/Directory&gt;
    </example>
    This is necessary since multiple <var>URL-paths</var> can map
    to the same filesystem location, potentially bypassing the
    <directive>ScriptAlias</directive> and revealing the source code
    of the CGI scripts if they are not restricted by a
    <directive module="core">Directory</directive> section.</note>
