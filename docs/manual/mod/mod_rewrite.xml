<description>Provides a rule-based rewriting engine to rewrite requested
URLs on the fly</description>

<status>Extension</status>
<sourcefile>mod_rewrite.c</sourcefile>
<identifier>rewrite_module</identifier>

<summary>
	<p>The <module>mod_rewrite</module> module uses a rule-based rewriting 
      engine, based on a regular-expression parser, to rewrite requested URLs on
      the fly. By default, <module>mod_rewrite</module> maps a URL to a filesystem 
      path. However, it can also be used to redirect one URL to another URL, or
      to invoke an internal proxy fetch.</p>
      <p><module>mod_rewrite</module> provides a flexible and powerful way to 
      manipulate URLs using an unlimited number of rules. Each rule can have an 
      unlimited number of attached rule conditions, to allow you to rewrite URL
      based on server variables, environment variables, HTTP headers, or time 
      stamps.</p>
      <p><module>mod_rewrite</module> operates on the full URL path, including the
      path-info section. A rewrite rule can be invoked in 
      <code>httpd.conf</code> or in <code>.htaccess</code>. The path generated 
      by a rewrite rule can include a query string, or can lead to internal 
      sub-processing, external request redirection, or internal proxy 
      throughput.</p>

      <p>Further details, discussion, and examples, are provided in the
      <a href="../rewrite/">detailed mod_rewrite documentation</a>.</p>
</summary>

<section><title>Logging</title>

    <p><module>mod_rewrite</module> offers detailed logging of its actions
    at the <code>trace1</code> to <code>trace8</code> log levels. The
    log level can be set specifically for <module>mod_rewrite</module>
    using the <directive module="core">LogLevel</directive> directive: Up to
    level <code>debug</code>, no actions are logged, while <code>trace8</code>
    means that practically all actions are logged.</p>

    <note>
      Using a high trace log level for <module>mod_rewrite</module>
      will slow down your Apache HTTP Server dramatically! Use a log
      level than <code>trace2</code> only for debugging!

<default>RewriteEngine off</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>

      <p>The <directive>RewriteEngine</directive> directive enables or
      disables the runtime rewriting engine. If it is set to
      <code>off</code> this module does no runtime processing at
      all. It does not even update the <code>SCRIPT_URx</code>
      environment variables.</p>

      <p>Use this directive to disable the module instead of
      commenting out all the <directive
      module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive> directives!</p>

      <p>Note that rewrite configurations are not
      inherited by virtual hosts. This means that you need to have a
      <code>RewriteEngine on</code> directive for each virtual host
      in which you wish to use rewrite rules.</p>

      <p><directive>RewriteMap</directive> directives of the type <code>prg</code>
      are not started during server initialization if they're defined in a
      context that does not have <directive>RewriteEngine</directive>  set to
      <code>on</code></p>

<override>FileInfo</override>
<compatibility><code>MaxRedirects</code> is no longer available in version 2.1 and
later</compatibility>
<usage>

      <p>The <directive>RewriteOptions</directive> directive sets some
      special options for the current per-server or per-directory
      configuration. The <em>Option</em> string can currently
      only be one of the following:</p>

      <dl>
      <dt><code>inherit</code></dt>
      <dd>This forces the current configuration to inherit the
      configuration of the parent. In per-virtual-server context,
      this means that the maps, conditions and rules of the main
      server are inherited. In per-directory context this means
      that conditions and rules of the parent directory's
      <code>.htaccess</code> configuration or
      <directive type="section" module="core">Directory</directive>
      sections are inherited. The inherited rules are virtually copied
      to the section where this directive is being used. If used in
      combination with local rules, the inherited rules are copied behind
      the local rules. The position of this directive - below or above
      of local rules - has no influence on this behavior. If local
      rules forced the rewriting to stop, the inherited rules won't
      be processed.</dd>

<name>RewriteMap</name>
<description>Defines a mapping function for key-lookup</description>
<syntax>RewriteMap <em>MapName</em> <em>MapType</em>:<em>MapSource</em>
</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>
<compatibility>The choice of different dbm types is available in
Apache HTTP Server 2.0.41 and later</compatibility>

<usage>
      <p>The <directive>RewriteMap</directive> directive defines a
      <em>Rewriting Map</em> which can be used inside rule
      substitution strings by the mapping-functions to
      insert/substitute fields through a key lookup. The source of
      this lookup can be of various types.</p>

      <p>The <a id="mapfunc" name="mapfunc"><em>MapName</em></a> is
      the name of the map and will be used to specify a
      mapping-function for the substitution strings of a rewriting
      rule via one of the following constructs:</p>

      <p class="indent">
        <strong><code>${</code> <em>MapName</em> <code>:</code>
        <em>LookupKey</em> <code>}</code><br />
         <code>${</code> <em>MapName</em> <code>:</code>
        <em>LookupKey</em> <code>|</code> <em>DefaultValue</em>
        <code>}</code></strong>
      </p>

      <p>When such a construct occurs, the map <em>MapName</em> is
      consulted and the key <em>LookupKey</em> is looked-up. If the
      key is found, the map-function construct is substituted by
      <em>SubstValue</em>. If the key is not found then it is
      substituted by <em>DefaultValue</em> or by the empty string
      if no <em>DefaultValue</em> was specified.</p>

      <p>For example, you might define a
      <directive>RewriteMap</directive> as:</p>

      <example>
      RewriteMap examplemap txt:/path/to/file/map.txt
      </example>

      <p>You would then be able to use this map in a
      <directive>RewriteRule</directive> as follows:</p>

      <example>
      RewriteRule ^/ex/(.*) ${examplemap:$1}
      </example>

      <p>The following combinations for <em>MapType</em> and
      <em>MapSource</em> can be used:</p>

    <dl>

    <dt>txt</dt>
        <dd>A plain text file containing space-separated key-value
        pairs, one per line. (<a href="../rewrite/rewritemap.html#txt">Details ...</a>)</dd>

    <dt>rnd</dt>
        <dd>Randomly selects an entry from a plain text file (<a href="../rewrite/rewritemap.html#rnd">Details ...</a>)</dd>

    <dt>dbm</dt>
        <dd>Looks up an entry in a dbm file containing name, value
        pairs. Hash is constructed from a plain text file format using
        the <code><a href="../programs/httxt2dbm.html">httxt2dbm</a></code> 
        utility.  (<a href="../rewrite/rewritemap.html#dbm">Details ...</a>)</dd>

    <dt>int</dt>
        <dd>One of the four available internal functions provided by
        <code>RewriteMap</code>: toupper, tolower, escape or
        unescape. (<a href="../rewrite/rewritemap.html#int">Details ...</a>)</dd>

    <dt>prg</dt>
        <dd>Calls an external program or script to process the
        rewriting. (<a href="../rewrite/rewritemap.html#prg">Details ...</a>)</dd>

    <dt>dbd or fastdbd</dt>
        <dd>A SQL SELECT statement to be performed to look up the

<name>RewriteBase</name>
<description>Sets the base URL for per-directory rewrites</description>
<syntax>RewriteBase <em>URL-path</em></syntax>
<default>None</default>
<contextlist><context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context>
</contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>
      <p>The <directive>RewriteBase</directive> directive explicitly
      sets the base URL-path (not filesystem directory path!)  for per-directory rewrites.
      When you use a <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive>
      in a <code>.htaccess</code> file, <module>mod_rewrite</module> strips off
      the local directory prefix before processing, then rewrites the rest of 
      the URL. When the rewrite is completed, <module>mod_rewrite</module>
      automatically adds the local directory prefix back on to the path.</p>
      
      <p>This directive is <em>required</em> for per-directory rewrites whose context
      is a directory made available via the <directive module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>
      directive.</p>

      <p>If your URL path does not exist verbatim on the filesystem,
      or isn't directly under your <directive module="core">DocumentRoot</directive>,
      you must use <directive>RewriteBase</directive> in every
      <code>.htaccess</code> file where you want to use <directive
      module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive> directives.</p>

      <p>The example below demonstrates how to map 
      http://example.com/myapp/index.html to 
      /home/www/example/newsite.html, in a <code>.htaccess</code> file. This 
      assumes that the content available at
      http://example.com/ is on disk at /home/www/example/</p>
<example>
<pre>
RewriteEngine On
# The URL-path used to get to this context, not the filesystem path
RewriteBase /myapp/
RewriteRule ^index\.html$  newsite.html
</pre>
</example>

<name>RewriteCond</name>
<description>Defines a condition under which rewriting will take place

<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>
      <p>The <directive>RewriteCond</directive> directive defines a
      rule condition. One or more <directive>RewriteCond</directive>
      can precede a <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive>
      directive. The following rule is then only used if both
      the current state of the URI matches its pattern, <strong
      >and</strong> if these conditions are met.</p>

      <p><em>TestString</em> is a string which can contain the
      following expanded constructs in addition to plain text:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RewriteRule backreferences</strong>: These are
          backreferences of the form <strong><code>$N</code></strong>
          (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 9). $1 to $9 provide access to the grouped
          parts (in parentheses) of the pattern, from the
          <code>RewriteRule</code> which is subject to the current
          set of <code>RewriteCond</code> conditions. $0 provides
          access to the whole string matched by that pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RewriteCond backreferences</strong>: These are
          backreferences of the form <strong><code>%N</code></strong>
          (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 9). %1 to %9 provide access to the grouped
          parts (again, in parentheses) of the pattern, from the last matched
          <code>RewriteCond</code> in the current set
          of conditions. %0 provides access to the whole string matched by
          that pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RewriteMap expansions</strong>: These are
          expansions of the form <strong><code
          >${mapname:key|default}</code></strong>.
          See <a href="#mapfunc">the documentation for
          RewriteMap</a> for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server-Variables</strong>: These are variables of
          the form
            <strong><code>%{</code> <em>NAME_OF_VARIABLE</em>
            <code>}</code></strong>
          where <em>NAME_OF_VARIABLE</em> can be a string taken
          from the following list:

      <p>Other things you should be aware of:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
        <p>The variables SCRIPT_FILENAME and REQUEST_FILENAME
        contain the same value - the value of the
        <code>filename</code> field of the internal
        <code>request_rec</code> structure of the Apache HTTP Server.
        The first name is the commonly known CGI variable name
        while the second is the appropriate counterpart of
        REQUEST_URI (which contains the value of the
        <code>uri</code> field of <code>request_rec</code>).</p>
        <p>If a substitution occurred and the rewriting continues,
        the value of both variables will be updated accordingly.</p>
        <p>If used in per-server context (<em>i.e.</em>, before the
        request is mapped to the filesystem) SCRIPT_FILENAME and
        REQUEST_FILENAME cannot contain the full local filesystem
        path since the path is unknown at this stage of processing.
        Both variables will initially contain the value of REQUEST_URI
        in that case. In order to obtain the full local filesystem
        path of the request in per-server context, use an URL-based
        look-ahead <code>%{LA-U:REQUEST_FILENAME}</code> to determine
        the final value of REQUEST_FILENAME.</p></li>

        <li>
        <code>%{ENV:variable}</code>, where <em>variable</em> can be
        any environment variable, is also available.
        This is looked-up via internal
        Apache httpd structures and (if not found there) via
        <code>getenv()</code> from the Apache httpd server process.</li>

        <li>
        <code>%{SSL:variable}</code>, where <em>variable</em> is the
        name of an <a href="mod_ssl.html#envvars">SSL environment
        variable</a>, can be used whether or not
        <module>mod_ssl</module> is loaded, but will always expand to
        the empty string if it is not.  Example:
        <code>%{SSL:SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE}</code> may expand to
        <code>128</code>.</li>

        <li>
        <code>%{HTTP:header}</code>, where <em>header</em> can be
        any HTTP MIME-header name, can always be used to obtain the
        value of a header sent in the HTTP request.
        Example: <code>%{HTTP:Proxy-Connection}</code> is
        the value of the HTTP header
        ``<code>Proxy-Connection:</code>''.
        <p>If a HTTP header is used in a condition this header is added to
        the Vary header of the response in case the condition evaluates to
        to true for the request. It is <strong>not</strong> added if the
        condition evaluates to false for the request. Adding the HTTP header
        to the Vary header of the response is needed for proper caching.</p>
        <p>It has to be kept in mind that conditions follow a short circuit
        logic in the case of the '<strong><code>ornext|OR</code></strong>' flag
        so that certain conditions might not be evaluated at all.</p></li>

        <li>
        <code>%{LA-U:variable}</code> can be used for look-aheads which perform
        an internal (URL-based) sub-request to determine the final
        value of <em>variable</em>. This can be used to access
        variable for rewriting which is not available at the current
        stage, but will be set in a later phase.
        <p>For instance, to rewrite according to the
        <code>REMOTE_USER</code> variable from within the
        per-server context (<code>httpd.conf</code> file) you must
        use <code>%{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}</code> - this
        variable is set by the authorization phases, which come
        <em>after</em> the URL translation phase (during which mod_rewrite
        operates).</p>
        <p>On the other hand, because mod_rewrite implements
        its per-directory context (<code>.htaccess</code> file) via
        the Fixup phase of the API and because the authorization
        phases come <em>before</em> this phase, you just can use
        <code>%{REMOTE_USER}</code> in that context.</p></li>

        <li>
        <code>%{LA-F:variable}</code> can be used to perform an internal
        (filename-based) sub-request, to determine the final value
        of <em>variable</em>. Most of the time, this is the same as
        LA-U above.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>CondPattern</em> is the condition pattern,
       a regular expression which is applied to the
      current instance of the <em>TestString</em>.
      <em>TestString</em> is first evaluated, before being matched against
      <em>CondPattern</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em>CondPattern</em> is a
      <em>perl compatible regular expression</em> with some
      additions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You can prefix the pattern string with a
        '<code>!</code>' character (exclamation mark) to specify a
        <strong>non</strong>-matching pattern.</li>

        <li>
          There are some special variants of <em>CondPatterns</em>.
          Instead of real regular expression strings you can also
          use one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>'<strong>&lt;CondPattern</strong>' (lexicographically
            precedes)<br />
            Treats the <em>CondPattern</em> as a plain string and
            compares it lexicographically to <em>TestString</em>. True if
            <em>TestString</em> lexicographically precedes
            <em>CondPattern</em>.</li>

            <li>'<strong>&gt;CondPattern</strong>' (lexicographically
            follows)<br />
            Treats the <em>CondPattern</em> as a plain string and
            compares it lexicographically to <em>TestString</em>. True if
            <em>TestString</em> lexicographically follows
            <em>CondPattern</em>.</li>

            <li>'<strong>=CondPattern</strong>' (lexicographically
            equal)<br />
            Treats the <em>CondPattern</em> as a plain string and
            compares it lexicographically to <em>TestString</em>. True if
            <em>TestString</em> is lexicographically equal to
            <em>CondPattern</em> (the two strings are exactly
            equal, character for character). If <em>CondPattern</em>
            is <code>""</code> (two quotation marks) this
            compares <em>TestString</em> to the empty string.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-d</strong>' (is
            <strong>d</strong>irectory)<br />
             Treats the <em>TestString</em> as a pathname and tests
            whether or not it exists, and is a directory.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-f</strong>' (is regular
            <strong>f</strong>ile)<br />
             Treats the <em>TestString</em> as a pathname and tests
            whether or not it exists, and is a regular file.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-s</strong>' (is regular file, with
            <strong>s</strong>ize)<br />
            Treats the <em>TestString</em> as a pathname and tests
            whether or not it exists, and is a regular file with size greater
            than zero.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-l</strong>' (is symbolic
            <strong>l</strong>ink)<br />
            Treats the <em>TestString</em> as a pathname and tests
            whether or not it exists, and is a symbolic link.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-x</strong>' (has e<strong>x</strong>ecutable
            permissions)<br />
            Treats the <em>TestString</em> as a pathname and tests
            whether or not it exists, and has executable permissions.
            These permissions are determined according to
            the underlying OS.</li>

            <li>'<strong>-F</strong>' (is existing file, via
            subrequest)<br />
            Checks whether or not <em>TestString</em> is a valid file,
            accessible via all the server's currently-configured
            access controls for that path. This uses an internal
            subrequest to do the check, so use it with care -
            it can impact your server's performance!</li>

            <li>'<strong>-U</strong>' (is existing URL, via
            subrequest)<br />
            Checks whether or not <em>TestString</em> is a valid URL,
            accessible via all the server's currently-configured
            access controls for that path. This uses an internal
            subrequest to do the check, so use it with care -
            it can impact your server's performance!</li>
          </ul>

<note><title>Note:</title>
              All of these tests can
              also be prefixed by an exclamation mark ('!') to
              negate their meaning.
</note>
        </li>

        <li>You can also set special flags for
      <em>CondPattern</em> by appending
        <strong><code>[</code><em>flags</em><code>]</code></strong>
      as the third argument to the <code>RewriteCond</code>
      directive, where <em>flags</em> is a comma-separated list of any of the
      following flags:

      <ul>
        <li>'<strong><code>nocase|NC</code></strong>'
        (<strong>n</strong>o <strong>c</strong>ase)<br />
        This makes the test case-insensitive - differences
        between 'A-Z' and 'a-z' are ignored, both in the
        expanded <em>TestString</em> and the <em>CondPattern</em>.
        This flag is effective only for comparisons between
        <em>TestString</em> and <em>CondPattern</em>. It has no
        effect on filesystem and subrequest checks.</li>

        <li>
          '<strong><code>ornext|OR</code></strong>'
          (<strong>or</strong> next condition)<br />
          Use this to combine rule conditions with a local OR
          instead of the implicit AND. Typical example:

<example>
<pre>
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST}  ^host1.*  [OR]
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST}  ^host2.*  [OR]
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST}  ^host3.*
RewriteRule ...some special stuff for any of these hosts...
</pre>
</example>

          Without this flag you would have to write the condition/rule
          pair three times.
        </li>

        <li>'<strong><code>novary|NV</code></strong>'
        (<strong>n</strong>o <strong>v</strong>ary)<br />
        If a HTTP header is used in the condition, this flag prevents
        this header from being added to the Vary header of the response. <br />
        Using this flag might break proper caching of the response if
        the representation of this response varies on the value of this header.
        So this flag should be only used if the meaning of the Vary header
        is well understood.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
     </ol>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

       <p>To rewrite the Homepage of a site according to the
        ``<code>User-Agent:</code>'' header of the request, you can
        use the following: </p>

<example>
<pre>
RewriteCond  %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}  ^Mozilla.*
RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.max.html  [L]

RewriteCond  %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}  ^Lynx.*
RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.min.html  [L]

RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.std.html  [L]
</pre>
</example>

        <p>Explanation: If you use a browser which identifies itself
        as 'Mozilla' (including Netscape Navigator, Mozilla etc), then you
        get the max homepage (which could include frames, or other special
        features).
        If you use the Lynx browser (which is terminal-based), then
        you get the min homepage (which could be a version designed for
        easy, text-only browsing).
        If neither of these conditions apply (you use any other browser,
        or your browser identifies itself as something non-standard), you get
        the std (standard) homepage.</p>

<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>
      <p>The <directive>RewriteRule</directive> directive is the real
      rewriting workhorse. The directive can occur more than once,
      with each instance defining a single rewrite rule. The
      order in which these rules are defined is important - this is the order
      in which they will be applied at run-time.</p>

      <p><a id="patterns" name="patterns"><em>Pattern</em></a> is
      a perl compatible <a id="regexp" name="regexp">regular
      expression</a>. On the first RewriteRule it is applied to the (%-encoded)
      <a href="./directive-dict.html#Syntax">URL-path</a> of the request;
      subsequent patterns are applied to the output of the last matched
      RewriteRule.</p>

<note><title>What is matched?</title>
      <p>The <em>Pattern</em> will initially be matched against the part of the
      URL after the hostname and port, and before the query string.</p>

      <p>When the RewriteRule appears in per-directory (htaccess) context, the 
      <em>Pattern</em> is matched against what remains of the URL after removing
      the prefix that lead Apache httpd to the current rules (see the 
      <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteBase</directive>).  The removed prefix
      always ends with a slash, meaning the matching occurs against a string which
      never has a leading slash.  A <em>Pattern</em> with <code>^/</code> never
      matches in per-directory context.</p>

      <p>If you wish to match against the hostname, port, or query string, use a
      <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteCond</directive> with the
      <code>%{HTTP_HOST}</code>, <code>%{SERVER_PORT}</code>, or
      <code>%{QUERY_STRING}</code> variables respectively. If you wish to 
      match against the full URL-path in a per-directory (htaccess) RewriteRule, 
      use the <code>%{REQUEST_URI}</code> variable.</p>

</note>

      <p>For some hints on <glossary ref="regex">regular
      expressions</glossary>, see
      the <a href="../rewrite/intro.html#regex">mod_rewrite
      Introduction</a>.</p>

      <p>In mod_rewrite, the NOT character
      ('<code>!</code>') is also available as a possible pattern
      prefix. This enables you to negate a pattern; to say, for instance:
      ``<em>if the current URL does <strong>NOT</strong> match this
      pattern</em>''. This can be used for exceptional cases, where
      it is easier to match the negative pattern, or as a last
      default rule.</p>

<note><title>Note</title>
When using the NOT character to negate a pattern, you cannot include
grouped wildcard parts in that pattern. This is because, when the
pattern does NOT match (ie, the negation matches), there are no
contents for the groups. Thus, if negated patterns are used, you
cannot use <code>$N</code> in the substitution string!
</note>

      <p>The <a id="rhs" name="rhs"><em>Substitution</em></a> of a
      rewrite rule is the string that replaces the original URL-path that
      was matched by <em>Pattern</em>.  The <em>Substitution</em> may
      be a:</p>

      <dl>

        <dt>file-system path</dt>

        <dd>Designates the location on the file-system of the resource
        to be delivered to the client.</dd>

        <dt>URL-path</dt>

        <dd>A <directive
        module="core">DocumentRoot</directive>-relative path to the
        resource to be served. Note that <module>mod_rewrite</module>
        tries to guess whether you have specified a file-system path
        or a URL-path by checking to see if the first segment of the
        path exists at the root of the file-system. For example, if
        you specify a <em>Substitution</em> string of
        <code>/www/file.html</code>, then this will be treated as a
        URL-path <em>unless</em> a directory named <code>www</code>
        exists at the root or your file-system, in which case it will
        be treated as a file-system path. If you wish other
        URL-mapping directives (such as <directive
        module="mod_alias">Alias</directive>) to be applied to the
        resulting URL-path, use the <code>[PT]</code> flag as
        described below.</dd>

        <dt>Absolute URL</dt>

        <dd>If an absolute URL is specified,
        <module>mod_rewrite</module> checks to see whether the
        hostname matches the current host. If it does, the scheme and
        hostname are stripped out and the resulting path is treated as
        a URL-path. Otherwise, an external redirect is performed for
        the given URL. To force an external redirect back to the
        current host, see the <code>[R]</code> flag below.</dd>

        <dt><code>-</code> (dash)</dt>

        <dd>A dash indicates that no substitution should be performed
        (the existing path is passed through untouched). This is used
        when a flag (see below) needs to be applied without changing
        the path.</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>In addition to plain text, the <em>Substition</em> string can include</p>

      <ol>
        <li>back-references (<code>$N</code>) to the RewriteRule
        pattern</li>

        <li>back-references (<code>%N</code>) to the last matched
        RewriteCond pattern</li>

        <li>server-variables as in rule condition test-strings
        (<code>%{VARNAME}</code>)</li>

        <li><a href="#mapfunc">mapping-function</a> calls
        (<code>${mapname:key|default}</code>)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Back-references are identifiers of the form
      <code>$</code><strong>N</strong>
      (<strong>N</strong>=0..9), which will be replaced
      by the contents of the <strong>N</strong>th group of the
      matched <em>Pattern</em>. The server-variables are the same
      as for the <em>TestString</em> of a <code>RewriteCond</code>
      directive. The mapping-functions come from the
      <code>RewriteMap</code> directive and are explained there.
      These three types of variables are expanded in the order above.</p>

      <p>As already mentioned, all rewrite rules are
      applied to the <em>Substitution</em> (in the order in which
      they are defined
      in the config file). The URL is <strong>completely
      replaced</strong> by the <em>Substitution</em> and the
      rewriting process continues until all rules have been applied,
      or it is explicitly terminated by a
      <code><strong>L</strong></code> flag.</p>

     <note><title>Modifying the Query String</title>
      <p>By default, the query string is passed through unchanged. You
      can, however, create URLs in the substitution string containing
      a query string part. Simply use a question mark inside the
      substitution string to indicate that the following text should
      be re-injected into the query string. When you want to erase an
      existing query string, end the substitution string with just a
      question mark. To combine new and old query strings, use the
      <code>[QSA]</code> flag.</p>
     </note>

      <p>Additionally you can set special <a name="rewriteflags"
      id="rewriteflags">actions</a> to be performed by
      appending <strong><code>[</code><em>flags</em><code>]</code></strong>
      as the third argument to the <code>RewriteRule</code>
      directive. <em>Flags</em> is a comma-separated list, surround by square
      brackets, of any of the flags in the following table. More
      details, and examples, for each flag, are available in the <a
      href="../rewrite/flags.html">Rewrite Flags document</a>.</p>

<note><title>Home directory expansion</title>
<p> When the substitution string begins with a string
resembling "/~user" (via explicit text or backreferences), mod_rewrite performs
home directory expansion independent of the presence or configuration
of <module>mod_userdir</module>.</p>

<p> This expansion does not occur when the <em>PT</em>
flag is used on the <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive>
directive.</p>
</note>

<note><title>Per-directory Rewrites</title>

<p>The rewrite engine may be used in <a
href="../howto/htaccess.html">.htaccess</a> files.  To enable the
rewrite engine for these files you need to set
"<code>RewriteEngine On</code>" <strong>and</strong>
"<code>Options FollowSymLinks</code>" must be enabled. If your
administrator has disabled override of <code>FollowSymLinks</code> for
a user's directory, then you cannot use the rewrite engine. This
restriction is required for security reasons.</p>

<p>When using the rewrite engine in <code>.htaccess</code> files the
per-directory prefix (which always is the same for a specific
directory) is automatically <em>removed</em> for the pattern matching
and automatically <em>added</em> after the substitution has been
done. This feature is essential for many sorts of rewriting; without
this, you would always have to match the parent directory, which is
not always possible.  There is one exception: If a substitution string
starts with <code>http://</code>, then the directory prefix will
<strong>not</strong> be added, and an external redirect (or proxy
throughput, if using flag <strong>P</strong>) is forced.  See the
<directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteBase</directive> directive for
more information.</p>

<p>The rewrite engine may also be used in <directive type="section"
module="core">Directory</directive> sections with the same
prefix-matching rules as would be applied to <code>.htaccess</code>
files.  It is usually simpler, however, to avoid the prefix substitution
complication by putting the rewrite rules in the main server or
virtual host context, rather than in a <directive type="section"
module="core">Directory</directive> section.</p>

<p>Although rewrite rules are syntactically permitted in <directive
type="section" module="core">Location</directive> and <directive
type="section" module="core">Files</directive> sections, this
should never be necessary and is unsupported.</p>

     <p>Here are all possible substitution combinations and their
      meanings:</p>
