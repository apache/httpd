<summary>
It is a module that sends static content at a bandwidth rate limit, defined by the various old modem standards. So, you can browse your site with a 56k V.92 modem, by adding something like this:

<example>
&lt;Location /mysite&gt;<br />
ModemStandard V.92<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;
</example>

Previously to do bandwidth rate limiting modules would have to block an entire thread, for each client, and insert sleeps to slow the bandwidth down.  Using the new suspend feature, a handler can get callback N milliseconds in the future, and it will be invoked by the Event MPM on a different thread, once the timer hits.  From there the handler can continue to send data to the client.
