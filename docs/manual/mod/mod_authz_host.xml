<summary>
    <p>The authorization providers implemented by <module>mod_authz_host</module> are
    registered using the <directive module="mod_authz_core">Require</directive>
    directive. The directive can be referenced within a 
    <directive module="core" type="section">Directory</directive>,
    <directive module="core" type="section">Files</directive>, 
    or <directive module="core" type="section">Location</directive> section
    as well as <code><a href="core.html#accessfilename">.htaccess</a>
    </code> files to control access to particular parts of the server.
    Access can be controlled based on the client hostname or IP address.</p>

    <p>In general, access restriction directives apply to all
    access methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
    <code>POST</code>, etc). This is the desired behavior in most
    cases. However, it is possible to restrict some methods, while
    leaving other methods unrestricted, by enclosing the directives
    in a <directive module="core" type="section">Limit</directive> section.</p>

<section id="requiredirectives"><title>The Require Directives</title>

    <p>Apache's <directive module="mod_authz_core">Require</directive> 
    directive is used during the authorization phase to ensure that a user is allowed or
    denied access to a resource.  mod_authz_host extends the 
    authorization types with <code>ip</code> and <code>host</code>.
    Other authorization types may also be 
    used but may require that additional authorization modules be loaded.</p>

    <p>These authorization providers affect which hosts can
    access an area of the server. Access can be controlled by
    hostname, IP Address, or IP Address range.</p>

<section id="reqip"><title>Require ip</title>

    <p>The <code>ip</code> provider allows access to the server
    to be controlled based on the IP address of the remote client. 
    When <code>Require ip <var>ip-address</var></code> is specified, 
    then the request is allowed access if the IP address matches.</p>

    <p>A full IP address:</p>
    
    <example>
      Require ip 10.1.2.3<br />
      Require ip 192.168.1.104 192.168.1.205
    </example>

    <p>An IP address of a host allowed access</p>
    
    <p>A partial IP address:</p>
    
    <example>
      Require ip 10.1<br />
      Require ip 10 172.20 192.168.2
    </example>
    <p>The first 1 to 3 bytes of an IP address, for subnet
    restriction.</p>
    
    <p>A network/netmask pair:</p>
    
    <example>
      Require ip 10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0
    </example>
    <p>A network a.b.c.d, and a netmask w.x.y.z. For more
    fine-grained subnet restriction.</p>
    
    <p>A network/nnn CIDR specification:</p>
    
    <example>
      Require ip 10.1.0.0/16
    </example>
    <p>Similar to the previous case, except the netmask consists of
    nnn high-order 1 bits.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the last three examples above match exactly the
    same set of hosts.</p>
    
    <p>IPv6 addresses and IPv6 subnets can be specified as shown
    below:</p>
    
    <example>
     Require ip 2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea<br />
     Require ip 2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea/10
    </example>

<section id="reqhost"><title>Require host</title>

    <p>The <code>host</code> provider allows access to the server
    to be controlled based on the host name of the remote client. 
    When <code>Require host <var>host-name</var></code> is specified, 
    then the request is allowed access if the host name matches.</p>

    <p>A (partial) domain-name</p>
    
    <example>
    Require host example.org<br />
    Require host .net example.edu
    </example>
    
    <p>Hosts whose names match, or end in, this string are allowed
    access. Only complete components are matched, so the above
    example will match <code>foo.example.org</code> but it will not
    match <code>fooexample.org</code>. This configuration will cause
    Apache to perform a double reverse DNS lookup on the client IP
    address, regardless of the setting of the <directive
    module="core">HostnameLookups</directive> directive.  It will do
    a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address to find the associated
    hostname, and then do a forward lookup on the hostname to assure
    that it matches the original IP address.  Only if the forward
    and reverse DNS are consistent and the hostname matches will
    access be allowed.</p>

</section>

<section id="reqlocal"><title>Require local</title>
    <p>The <code>local</code> provider allows access to the server if any
    of the following conditions is true:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the client address matches 127.0.0.0/8</li>
        <li>the client address is ::1</li>
        <li>both the client and the server address of the connection are
        the same</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This allows a convenient way to match connections that originate from
    the local host:</p>

    <example>
    Require local
    </example>
