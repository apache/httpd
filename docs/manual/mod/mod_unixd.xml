<default>Group #-1</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>
<compatibility>Only valid in global server config since Apache
2.0</compatibility>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>Group</directive> directive sets the group under
    which the server will answer requests. In order to use this
    directive, the server must be run initially as <code>root</code>. If
    you start the server as a non-root user, it will fail to change to the
    specified group, and will instead continue to run as the group of the
    original user. <var>Unix-group</var> is one of:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>A group name</dt>
      <dd>Refers to the given group by name.</dd>

      <dt><code>#</code> followed by a group number.</dt>
      <dd>Refers to a group by its number.</dd>
    </dl>

    <example><title>Example</title>
      Group www-group
    </example>

    <p>It is recommended that you set up a new group specifically for
    running the server. Some admins use user <code>nobody</code>,
    but this is not always possible or desirable.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Security</title>
      <p>Don't set <directive>Group</directive> (or <directive

<syntax>User <var>unix-userid</var></syntax>
<default>User #-1</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>
<compatibility>Only valid in global server config since Apache
2.0</compatibility>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>User</directive> directive sets the user ID as
    which the server will answer requests. In order to use this
    directive, the server must be run initially as <code>root</code>.
    If you start the server as a non-root user, it will fail to change
    to the lesser privileged user, and will instead continue to run as
    that original user. If you do start the server as <code>root</code>,
    then it is normal for the parent process to remain running as root.
    <var>Unix-userid</var> is one of:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>A username</dt>
      <dd>Refers to the given user by name.</dd>

      <dt># followed by a user number.</dt>
      <dd>Refers to a user by its number.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The user should have no privileges that result in it being
    able to access files that are not intended to be visible to the
    outside world, and similarly, the user should not be able to
    execute code that is not meant for HTTP requests. It is
    recommended that you set up a new user and group specifically for
    running the server. Some admins use user <code>nobody</code>, but
    this is not always desirable, since the <code>nobody</code> user
    can have other uses on the system.</p>

<default>none</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<compatibility>Available in Apache 2.2.10 and later</compatibility>

<usage>
    <p>This directive tells the server to <var>chroot(8)</var> to the
    specified directory after startup, but before accepting requests
    over the 'net.</p>
    <p>Note that running the server under chroot is not simple,
    and requires additional setup, particularly if you are running
    scripts such as CGI or PHP.  Please make sure you are properly
    familiar with the operation of chroot before attempting to use
    this feature.</p>

<usage>
    <p>When On, startup will fail if the suexec binary doesn't exist
    or has an invalid owner or file mode.</p>
    <p>When Off, suEXEC will be disabled even if the suexec binary exists
    and has a valid owner and file mode.</p>
