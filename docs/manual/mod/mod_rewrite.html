Welcome to mod_rewrite, the Swiss Army Knife of URL manipulation!

<P>
This module uses a rule-based rewriting engine (based on a regular-expression
parser) to rewrite requested URLs on the fly. It supports an unlimited number
of rules and an unlimited number of attached rule conditions for each rule to
provide a really flexible and powerful URL manipulation mechanism.  The URL
manipulations can depend on various tests, for instance server variables,
environment variables, HTTP headers, time stamps and even external database
lookups in various formats can be used to achieve a really granular URL
matching. 

<P>
This module operates on the full URLs (including the path-info part) both in
per-server context (<CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>) and per-directory context
(<CODE>.htaccess</CODE>) and can even generate query-string parts on result.
The rewritten result can lead to internal sub-processing, external request
redirection or even to an internal proxy throughput.

<P>
But all this functionality and flexibility has its drawback: complexity. So
don't expect to understand this entire module in just one day.

<P>
This module was invented and originally written in April 1996<BR>
and gifted exclusively to the The Apache Group in July 1997 by

<P>
The internal processing of this module is very complex but needs to be
explained once even to the average user to avoid common mistakes and to let
you exploit its full functionality. 

<H2><A NAME="InternalAPI">API Phases</A></H2>

<P>
First you have to understand that when Apache processes a HTTP request it does
this in phases. A hook for each of these phases is provided by the Apache API.
Mod_rewrite uses two of these hooks: the URL-to-filename translation hook
which is used after the HTTP request has been read but before any authorization
starts and the Fixup hook which is triggered after the authorization phases
and after the per-directory config files (<CODE>.htaccess</CODE>) have been 
read, but before the content handler is activated.

<P>
So, after a request comes in and Apache has determined the corresponding
server (or virtual server) the rewriting engine starts processing of all
mod_rewrite directives from the per-server configuration in the
URL-to-filename phase. A few steps later when the final data directories are
found, the per-directory configuration directives of mod_rewrite are triggered
in the Fixup phase. In both situations mod_rewrite rewrites URLs either to new
URLs or to filenames, although there is no obvious distinction between them.
This is a usage of the API which was not intended to be this way when the API
was designed, but as of Apache 1.x this is the only way mod_rewrite can
operate. To make this point more clear remember the following two points:

<OL>
<LI>Although mod_rewrite rewrites URLs to URLs, URLs to filenames and
    even filenames to filenames, the API currently provides only a
    URL-to-filename hook.  In Apache 2.0 the two missing hooks will be
    added to make the processing more clear. But this point has no
    drawbacks for the user, it is just a fact which should be
    remembered: Apache does more in the URL-to-filename hook than the
    API intends for it.
<P>
<LI>Unbelievably mod_rewrite provides URL manipulations in per-directory
    context, <EM>i.e.</EM>, within <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files,
    although these are reached a very long time after the URLs have
    been translated to filenames.  It has to be this way because
    <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files live in the filesystem, so processing
    has already reached this stage.  In other words: According to the
    API phases at this time it is too late for any URL manipulations.
    To overcome this chicken and egg problem mod_rewrite uses a trick:
    When you manipulate a URL/filename in per-directory context
    mod_rewrite first rewrites the filename back to its corresponding
    URL (which is usually impossible, but see the <CODE>RewriteBase</CODE>
    directive below for the trick to achieve this) and then initiates
    a new internal sub-request with the new URL. This restarts
    processing of the API phases.
    <P>
    Again mod_rewrite tries hard to make this complicated step totally
    transparent to the user, but you should remember here: While URL
    manipulations in per-server context are really fast and efficient,
    per-directory rewrites are slow and inefficient due to this chicken and
    egg problem. But on the other hand this is the only way mod_rewrite can
    provide (locally restricted) URL manipulations to the average user.
</OL>

<P>
Don't forget these two points!

<H2><A NAME="InternalRuleset">Ruleset Processing</A></H2>

Now when mod_rewrite is triggered in these two API phases, it reads the
configured rulesets from its configuration structure (which itself was either
created on startup for per-server context or during the directory walk of the
Apache kernel for per-directory context).  Then the URL rewriting engine is
started with the contained ruleset (one or more rules together with their
conditions). The operation of the URL rewriting engine itself is exactly the
same for both configuration contexts. Only the final result processing is
different.

<P>
The order of rules in the ruleset is important because the rewriting engine
processes them in a special (and not very obvious) order.  The
rule is this: The rewriting engine loops through the ruleset rule by rule
(<CODE>RewriteRule</CODE> directives) and when a particular rule matches it
optionally loops through existing corresponding conditions
(<CODE>RewriteCond</CODE> directives).  For historical reasons the conditions 
are given first, and so the control flow is a little bit long-winded. See
Figure 1 for more details.

<P>
As you can see, first the URL is matched against the <EM>Pattern</EM> of each
rule. When it fails mod_rewrite immediately stops processing this rule and
continues with the next rule. If the <EM>Pattern</EM> matches, mod_rewrite
looks for corresponding rule conditions. If none are present, it just
substitutes the URL with a new value which is constructed from the string
<EM>Substitution</EM> and goes on with its rule-looping. But if conditions
exist, it starts an inner loop for processing them in the order that
they are listed. For conditions the logic is different: we don't match a
pattern against the current URL. Instead we first create a string
<EM>TestString</EM> by expanding variables, back-references, map lookups,
<EM>etc.</EM> and then we try to match <EM>CondPattern</EM> against it. If the
pattern doesn't match, the complete set of conditions and the corresponding
rule fails.  If the pattern matches, then the next condition is processed
until no more conditions are available. If all conditions match, processing
is continued with the substitution of the URL with <EM>Substitution</EM>.

<h2><a name="quoting">Quoting Special Characters</a></h2>
<p>
As of Apache 1.3.20, special characters in <i>TestString</i> and
<i>Substitution</i> strings can be escaped (that is, treated as
normal characters without their usual special meaning) by prefixing them
with a slosh ('\') character.  In other words, you can include an
actual dollar-sign character in a <i>Substitution</i> string
by using '<code>\$</code>'; this keeps mod_rewrite from trying
to treat it as a backreference.
</p>

<H2><A NAME="InternalBackRefs">Regex Back-Reference Availability</A></H2>

One important thing here has to be remembered: Whenever you
use parentheses in <EM>Pattern</EM> or in one of the <EM>CondPattern</EM>,
back-references are internally created which can be used with the
strings <CODE>$N</CODE> and <CODE>%N</CODE> (see below). These
are available for creating the strings <EM>Substitution</EM> and
<EM>TestString</EM>. Figure 2 shows to which locations the back-references are
transfered for expansion.

    This forces the current configuration to inherit the configuration of the

The <CODE>RewriteMap</CODE> directive defines a <EM>Rewriting Map</EM>
which can be used inside rule substitution strings by the mapping-functions
to insert/substitute fields through a key lookup. The source of this
lookup can be of various types.
<P>

The <A NAME="mapfunc"><EM>MapName</EM></A> is the name of the map and will
be used to specify a mapping-function for the substitution strings of a
rewriting rule via one of the following constructs:

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
<CODE>${</CODE> <EM>MapName</EM> <CODE>:</CODE> <EM>LookupKey</EM>
<CODE>}</CODE><BR>
<CODE>${</CODE> <EM>MapName</EM> <CODE>:</CODE> <EM>LookupKey</EM>
<CODE>|</CODE> <EM>DefaultValue</EM> <CODE>}</CODE>
</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

When such a construct occurs the map <EM>MapName</EM>
is consulted and the key <EM>LookupKey</EM> is looked-up. If the key is
found, the map-function construct is substituted by <EM>SubstValue</EM>. If
the key is not found then it is substituted by <EM>DefaultValue</EM> or
by the empty string if no <EM>DefaultValue</EM> was specified.

<P>
The following combinations for <EM>MapType</EM> and <EM>MapSource</EM>
can be used:

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Standard Plain Text</STRONG><BR>
    MapType: <CODE>txt</CODE>, MapSource: Unix filesystem path to valid regular
    file
    <P>
    This is the standard rewriting map feature where the <EM>MapSource</EM> is
    a plain ASCII file containing either blank lines, comment lines (starting
    with a '#' character) or pairs like the following - one per line.

    Here the source is a program, not a map file. To create it you

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> For plain text and DBM format files the looked-up
keys are cached in-core
until the <CODE>mtime</CODE> of the mapfile changes or the server does a
restart. This way you can have map-functions in rules which are used

<P>
The <CODE>RewriteBase</CODE> directive explicitly sets the base URL for
per-directory rewrites. As you will see below, <CODE>RewriteRule</CODE> can be
used in per-directory config files (<CODE>.htaccess</CODE>). There it will act
locally, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the local directory prefix is stripped at this stage of
processing and your rewriting rules act only on the remainder. At the end
it is automatically added back to the path.

<P>
When a substitution occurs for a new URL, this module has to re-inject the URL
into the server processing. To be able to do this it needs to know what the
corresponding URL-prefix or URL-base is. By default this prefix is the
corresponding filepath itself. <STRONG>But at most websites URLs are
NOT directly related to physical filename paths, so this
assumption will usually be wrong!</STRONG> There you have to use the
<CODE>RewriteBase</CODE> directive to specify the correct URL-prefix.

<STRONG>Notice:</STRONG> If your webserver's URLs are <STRONG>not</STRONG>

<STRONG>Note - For Apache hackers:</STRONG><BR>
The following list gives detailed information about the internal
processing steps:

<P>
<PRE>
Request:
  /xyz/oldstuff.html

Internal Processing:
  /xyz/oldstuff.html     -&gt; /abc/def/oldstuff.html  (per-server Alias)
  /abc/def/oldstuff.html -&gt; /abc/def/newstuff.html  (per-dir    RewriteRule)
  /abc/def/newstuff.html -&gt; /xyz/newstuff.html      (per-dir    RewriteBase)
  /xyz/newstuff.html     -&gt; /abc/def/newstuff.html  (per-server Alias)

Result:
  /abc/def/newstuff.html
</PRE>

This seems very complicated but is the correct Apache internal processing,
because the per-directory rewriting comes too late in the process.  So,
when it occurs the (rewritten) request has to be re-injected into the Apache
kernel! BUT: While this seems like a serious overhead, it really isn't, because
this re-injection happens fully internally to the Apache server and the same
procedure is used by many other operations inside Apache. So, you can be
sure the design and implementation is correct.

Special Notes:

<LI>The variables SCRIPT_FILENAME and REQUEST_FILENAME contain the same
value, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the value of the <CODE>filename</CODE> field of
the internal
<CODE>request_rec</CODE> structure of the Apache server. The first name is
just the
commonly known CGI variable name while the second is the consistent
counterpart to REQUEST_URI (which contains the value of the <CODE>uri</CODE>
field of <CODE>request_rec</CODE>).

<P>
<LI>There is the special format: <CODE>%{ENV:variable}</CODE> where
<EM>variable</EM> can be any environment variable. This is looked-up via
internal Apache structures and (if not found there) via <CODE>getenv()</CODE>
from the Apache server process.

<P>
<LI>There is the special format: <CODE>%{HTTP:header}</CODE> where
<EM>header</EM> can be any HTTP MIME-header name. This is looked-up

is the value of the HTTP header ``<CODE>Proxy-Connection:</CODE>''.

<LI>There is the special format <CODE>%{LA-U:variable}</CODE> for look-aheads
which perform an internal (URL-based) sub-request to determine the final value

<CODE>REMOTE_USER</CODE> variable from within the per-server context

because this variable is set by the authorization phases which come
<EM>after</EM> the URL translation phase where mod_rewrite operates. On the
other hand, because mod_rewrite implements its per-directory context
(<CODE>.htaccess</CODE> file) via the Fixup phase of the API and because the
authorization phases come <EM>before</EM> this phase, you just can use
<CODE>%{REMOTE_USER}</CODE> there.

<P>
<LI>There is the special format: <CODE>%{LA-F:variable}</CODE> which performs an

<STRONG>Example:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

To rewrite the Homepage of a site according to the ``<CODE>User-Agent:</CODE>''

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
RewriteCond  %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}  ^Mozilla.*
RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.max.html  [L]

RewriteCond  %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}  ^Lynx.*
RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.min.html  [L]

RewriteRule  ^/$                 /homepage.std.html  [L]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Interpretation: If you use Netscape Navigator as your browser (which identifies
itself as 'Mozilla'), then you get the max homepage, which includes
Frames, <EM>etc.</EM> If you use the Lynx browser (which is Terminal-based), then you
get the min homepage, which contains no images, no tables, <EM>etc.</EM>  If you
use any other browser you get the standard homepage.

For more information about regular expressions either have a look at your
local regex(3) manpage or its <CODE>src/regex/regex.3</CODE> copy in the
Apache 1.3 distribution.  If you are interested in more detailed
information about regular expressions and their variants (POSIX regex, Perl
regex, <EM>etc.</EM>) have a look at the following dedicated book on this topic:

<P>
Additionally in mod_rewrite the NOT character ('<CODE>!</CODE>') is a possible
pattern prefix. This gives you the ability to negate a pattern; to say, for
instance: ``<EM>if the current URL does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> match this
pattern</EM>''. This can be used for exceptional cases, where it is easier to
match the negative pattern, or as a last default rule.

<P>
<TABLE WIDTH="70%" BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#E0E0F0" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD>
<STRONG>Notice:</STRONG> When using the NOT character to negate a pattern you cannot
have grouped wildcard parts in the pattern. This is impossible because when
the pattern does NOT match, there are no contents for the groups. In
consequence, if negated patterns are used, you cannot use <CODE>$N</CODE> in the
substitution string!
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
<A NAME="rhs"><EM>Substitution</EM></A> of a rewriting rule is the string
which is substituted for (or replaces) the original URL for which
<EM>Pattern</EM> matched.  Beside plain text you can use

<OL>
<LI>back-references <CODE>$N</CODE> to the RewriteRule pattern
<LI>back-references <CODE>%N</CODE> to the last matched RewriteCond pattern
<LI>server-variables as in rule condition test-strings (<CODE>%{VARNAME}</CODE>)
<LI><A HREF="#mapfunc">mapping-function</A> calls (<CODE>${mapname:key|default}</CODE>)
</OL>

Back-references are <CODE>$</CODE><STRONG>N</STRONG> (<STRONG>N</STRONG>=0..9) identifiers which
will be replaced by the contents of the <STRONG>N</STRONG>th group of the matched
<EM>Pattern</EM>. The server-variables are the same as for the
<EM>TestString</EM> of a <CODE>RewriteCond</CODE> directive. The
mapping-functions come from the <CODE>RewriteMap</CODE> directive and are
explained there. These three types of variables are expanded in the order of
the above list.

<P>
As already mentioned above, all the rewriting rules are applied to the
<EM>Substitution</EM> (in the order of definition in the config file).  The
URL is <STRONG>completely replaced</STRONG> by the <EM>Substitution</EM> and the
rewriting process goes on until there are no more rules unless explicitly
terminated by a <CODE><STRONG>L</STRONG></CODE> flag - see below.

<P>
There is a special substitution string named '<CODE>-</CODE>' which means:
<STRONG>NO substitution</STRONG>! Sounds silly? No, it is useful to provide rewriting
rules which <STRONG>only</STRONG> match some URLs but do no substitution, <EM>e.g.</EM>, in
conjunction with the <STRONG>C</STRONG> (chain) flag to be able to have more than one
pattern to be applied before a substitution occurs.

<P>
One more note: You can even create URLs in the substitution string containing
a query string part. Just use a question mark inside the substitution string
to indicate that the following stuff should be re-injected into the
QUERY_STRING.  When you want to erase an existing query string, end the
substitution string with just the question mark.

<P>
<TABLE WIDTH="70%" BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#E0E0F0" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: There is a special feature: When you prefix a substitution
field with <CODE>http://</CODE><EM>thishost</EM>[<EM>:thisport</EM>] then
<STRONG>mod_rewrite</STRONG> automatically strips it out.   This auto-reduction on
implicit external redirect URLs is a useful and important feature when
used in combination with a mapping-function which generates the hostname
part.  Have a look at the first example in the example section below to
understand this.

<STRONG>Remember:</STRONG> An unconditional external redirect to your own server will
not work with the prefix <CODE>http://thishost</CODE> because of this feature.
To achieve such a self-redirect, you have to use the <STRONG>R</STRONG>-flag (see
below).
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Additionally you can set special flags for <EM>Substitution</EM> by appending

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>
<CODE>[</CODE><EM>flags</EM><CODE>]</CODE>
</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

as the third argument to the <CODE>RewriteRule</CODE> directive. <EM>Flags</EM> is a
comma-separated list of the following flags:

<UL>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>redirect|R</CODE> [=<EM>code</EM>]</STRONG>' (force <A NAME="redirect"><STRONG>r</STRONG>edirect</A>)<BR>
    Prefix <EM>Substitution</EM>
    with <CODE>http://thishost[:thisport]/</CODE> (which makes the new URL a URI) to
    force a external redirection. If no <EM>code</EM> is given a HTTP response
    of 302 (MOVED TEMPORARILY) is used. If you want to use other response
    codes in the range 300-400 just specify them as a number or use
    one of the following symbolic names: <CODE>temp</CODE> (default), <CODE>permanent</CODE>,
    <CODE>seeother</CODE>.
    Use it for rules which should
    canonicalize the URL and give it back to the client, <EM>e.g.</EM>, translate
    ``<CODE>/~</CODE>'' into ``<CODE>/u/</CODE>'' or always append a slash to
    <CODE>/u/</CODE><EM>user</EM>, etc.<BR>
    <P>
    <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> When you use this flag, make sure that the
    substitution field is a valid URL! If not, you are redirecting to an
    invalid location!  And remember that this flag itself only prefixes the
    URL with <CODE>http://thishost[:thisport]/</CODE>, rewriting continues.
    Usually you also want to stop and do the redirection immediately.  To stop
    the rewriting you also have to provide the 'L' flag.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>forbidden|F</CODE></STRONG>' (force URL to be <STRONG>f</STRONG>orbidden)<BR>
    This forces the current URL to be forbidden, <EM>i.e.</EM>, it immediately sends
    back a HTTP response of 403 (FORBIDDEN). Use this flag in conjunction with
    appropriate RewriteConds to conditionally block some URLs.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>gone|G</CODE></STRONG>' (force URL to be <STRONG>g</STRONG>one)<BR>
    This forces the current URL to be gone, <EM>i.e.</EM>, it immediately sends back a
    HTTP response of 410 (GONE). Use this flag to mark pages which no longer
    exist as gone.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>proxy|P</CODE></STRONG>' (force <STRONG>p</STRONG>roxy)<BR>
    This flag forces the substitution part to be internally forced as a proxy
    request and immediately (<EM>i.e.</EM>, rewriting rule processing stops here) put
    through the <A HREF="mod_proxy.html">proxy module</A>. You have to make
    sure that the substitution string is a valid URI (<EM>e.g.</EM>,  typically starting
    with <CODE>http://</CODE><EM>hostname</EM>) which can be handled by the
    Apache proxy module. If not you get an error from the proxy module. Use
    this flag to achieve a more powerful implementation of the <A
    HREF="mod_proxy.html#proxypass">ProxyPass</A> directive, to map some
    remote stuff into the namespace of the local server.
    <P>
    Notice: To use this functionality make sure you have the proxy module
    compiled into your Apache server program.  If you don't know please check
    whether <CODE>mod_proxy.c</CODE> is part of the ``<CODE>httpd -l</CODE>''
    output. If yes, this functionality is available to mod_rewrite. If not,
    then you first have to rebuild the ``<CODE>httpd</CODE>'' program with
    mod_proxy enabled.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>last|L</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>l</STRONG>ast rule)<BR>
    Stop the rewriting process here and
    don't apply any more rewriting rules. This corresponds to the Perl
    <CODE>last</CODE> command or the <CODE>break</CODE> command from the C
    language. Use this flag to prevent the currently rewritten URL from being
    rewritten further by following rules. For
    example, use it to rewrite the root-path URL ('<CODE>/</CODE>') to a real
    one, <EM>e.g.</EM>, '<CODE>/e/www/</CODE>'.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>next|N</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>n</STRONG>ext round)<BR>
    Re-run the rewriting process (starting again with the first rewriting
    rule). Here the URL to match is again not the original URL but the URL
    from the last rewriting rule.  This corresponds to the Perl
    <CODE>next</CODE> command or the <CODE>continue</CODE> command from the C
    language. Use this flag to restart the rewriting process, <EM>i.e.</EM>,  to
    immediately go to the top of the loop. <BR>
    <STRONG>But be careful not to create an infinite loop!</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>chain|C</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>c</STRONG>hained with next rule)<BR>
    This flag chains the current rule with the next rule (which itself can
    be chained with the following rule, <EM>etc.</EM>). This has the following
    effect: if a rule matches, then processing continues as usual, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the
    flag has no effect. If the rule does <STRONG>not</STRONG> match, then all following
    chained rules are skipped.   For instance, use it to remove the
    ``<CODE>.www</CODE>'' part inside a per-directory rule set when you let an
    external redirect happen (where the ``<CODE>.www</CODE>'' part should not to
    occur!).
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>type|T</CODE></STRONG>=<EM>MIME-type</EM>' (force MIME <STRONG>t</STRONG>ype)<BR>
    Force the MIME-type of the target file to be <EM>MIME-type</EM>. For
    instance, this can be used to simulate the <CODE>mod_alias</CODE>
    directive <CODE>ScriptAlias</CODE> which internally forces all files inside
    the mapped directory to have a MIME type of
    ``<CODE>application/x-httpd-cgi</CODE>''.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>nosubreq|NS</CODE></STRONG>' (used only if <STRONG>n</STRONG>o internal <STRONG>s</STRONG>ub-request)<BR>
    This flag forces the rewriting engine to skip a rewriting rule if the
    current request is an internal sub-request. For instance, sub-requests
    occur internally in Apache when <CODE>mod_include</CODE> tries to find out
    information about possible directory default files (<CODE>index.xxx</CODE>).
    On sub-requests it is not always useful and even sometimes causes a failure to
    if the complete set of rules are applied. Use this flag to exclude some rules.<BR>
    <P>
    Use the following rule for your decision: whenever you prefix some URLs
    with CGI-scripts to force them to be processed by the CGI-script, the
    chance is high that you will run into problems (or even overhead) on sub-requests.
    In these cases, use this flag.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>nocase|NC</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>n</STRONG>o <STRONG>c</STRONG>ase)<BR>
	This makes the <EM>Pattern</EM> case-insensitive, <EM>i.e.</EM>, there is
	no difference between 'A-Z' and 'a-z' when <EM>Pattern</EM> is matched
	against the current URL.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>qsappend|QSA</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>q</STRONG>uery <STRONG>s</STRONG>tring
    <STRONG>a</STRONG>ppend)<BR> 
    This flag forces the rewriting engine to append a query
    string part in the substitution string to the existing one instead of
    replacing it.  Use this when you want to add more data to the query string
    via a rewrite rule.
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>noescape|NE</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>n</STRONG>o URI <STRONG>e</STRONG>scaping of output)<BR>
    This flag keeps mod_rewrite from applying the usual URI escaping
    rules to the result of a rewrite.  Ordinarily, special characters
    (such as '%', '$', ';', and so on) will be escaped into their
    hexcode equivalents ('%25', '%24', and '%3B', respectively); this
    flag prevents this from being done.  This allows percent symbols
    to appear in the output, as in
    <pre>
    RewriteRule /foo/(.*) /bar?arg=P1\%3d$1 [R,NE]
    </pre>
    which would turn '<code>/foo/zed</code>' into a safe request
    for '<code>/bar?arg=P1=zed</code>'.
    <TABLE WIDTH="70%" BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#E0E0F0" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=10>

    <STRONG>Notice:</STRONG> The <code>noescape</code> flag is only available

    </TD></TR>
    </TABLE>
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>passthrough|PT</CODE></STRONG>' (<STRONG>p</STRONG>ass <STRONG>t</STRONG>hrough to next handler)<BR>
    This flag forces the rewriting engine to set the <CODE>uri</CODE> field
    of the internal <CODE>request_rec</CODE> structure to the value
    of the <CODE>filename</CODE> field.  This flag is just a hack to be able
    to post-process the output of <CODE>RewriteRule</CODE> directives by
    <CODE>Alias</CODE>, <CODE>ScriptAlias</CODE>, <CODE>Redirect</CODE>, <EM>etc.</EM> directives
    from other URI-to-filename translators. A trivial example to show the
    semantics:
    If you want to rewrite <CODE>/abc</CODE> to <CODE>/def</CODE> via the rewriting
    engine of <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE> and then <CODE>/def</CODE> to <CODE>/ghi</CODE>
    with <CODE>mod_alias</CODE>:
    <PRE>
    RewriteRule ^/abc(.*)  /def$1 [PT]
    Alias       /def       /ghi
    </PRE>
    If you omit the <CODE>PT</CODE> flag then <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE>
    will do its job fine, <EM>i.e.</EM>, it rewrites <CODE>uri=/abc/...</CODE> to
    <CODE>filename=/def/...</CODE> as a full API-compliant URI-to-filename
    translator should do. Then <CODE>mod_alias</CODE> comes and tries to do a
    URI-to-filename transition which will not work.
    <P>
    Note: <STRONG>You have to use this flag if you want to intermix directives
    of different modules which contain URL-to-filename translators</STRONG>. The
    typical example is the use of <CODE>mod_alias</CODE> and
    <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE>..

    <STRONG>Note - For Apache hackers:</STRONG><BR>
    If the current Apache API had a
    filename-to-filename hook additionally to the URI-to-filename hook then
    we wouldn't need this flag!  But without  such a hook this flag is the
    only solution. The Apache Group has discussed this problem and will
    add such a hook in Apache version 2.0.

</TABLE>
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>skip|S</CODE></STRONG>=<EM>num</EM>' (<STRONG>s</STRONG>kip next rule(s))<BR>
    This flag forces the rewriting engine to skip the next <EM>num</EM> rules
    in sequence when the current rule matches. Use this to make pseudo
    if-then-else constructs: The last rule of the then-clause becomes
    <CODE>skip=N</CODE> where N is the number of rules in the else-clause.
    (This is <STRONG>not</STRONG> the same as the 'chain|C' flag!)
<P>
<LI>'<STRONG><CODE>env|E=</CODE></STRONG><EM>VAR</EM>:<EM>VAL</EM>' (set <STRONG>e</STRONG>nvironment variable)<BR>
    This forces an environment variable named <EM>VAR</EM> to be set to the
    value <EM>VAL</EM>, where <EM>VAL</EM> can contain regexp backreferences
    <CODE>$N</CODE> and <CODE>%N</CODE> which will be expanded. You can use this flag
    more than once to set more than one variable. The variables can be later
    dereferenced in many situations, but usually from
    within XSSI (via <CODE>&lt;!--#echo var="VAR"--&gt;</CODE>) or CGI (<EM>e.g.</EM>
    <CODE>$ENV{'VAR'}</CODE>).  Additionally you can dereference it in a
    following RewriteCond pattern via <CODE>%{ENV:VAR}</CODE>. Use this to strip
    but remember information from URLs.

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Never forget that <EM>Pattern</EM> is applied to a complete URL

automatically <EM>added</EM> after the substitution has been done.</STRONG> This feature is
essential for many sorts of rewriting, because without this prefix stripping
you have to match the parent directory which is not always possible.
<P>
There is one exception: If a substitution string starts with
``<CODE>http://</CODE>'' then the directory prefix will <STRONG>not</STRONG> be added and an
external redirect or proxy throughput (if flag <STRONG>P</STRONG> is used!) is forced!

<H2><A NAME="EnvVar">Environment Variables</A></H2>

This module keeps track of two additional (non-standard) CGI/SSI environment
variables named <CODE>SCRIPT_URL</CODE> and <CODE>SCRIPT_URI</CODE>. These contain
the <EM>logical</EM> Web-view to the current resource, while the standard CGI/SSI
variables <CODE>SCRIPT_NAME</CODE> and <CODE>SCRIPT_FILENAME</CODE> contain the
<EM>physical</EM> System-view. 

<P>
Notice: These variables hold the URI/URL <EM>as they were initially
requested</EM>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <EM>before</EM> any rewriting. This is
important because the rewriting process is primarily used to rewrite logical
URLs to physical pathnames.

We also have an <a href="../misc/rewriteguide.html">URL Rewriting
Guide</a> available, which provides a collection of practical solutions
for URL-based problems. There you can find real-life rulesets and
additional information about mod_rewrite.
