  <title>Override Class Index for .htaccess</title>
  <summary>
    <p>
      This is an index of the directives that are allowed in .htaccess files for
      each <directive module="core">AllowOverride</directive> setting. To
      determine the set of directives that your server configuration allows
      .htaccess users to use:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start with the set of directives in the <code>AllowOverrideList</code>
      for the directory in question. (By default, this is set to
      <code>None</code>.)</li>
      <li>Find the <code>AllowOverride</code> setting for the directory in
      question. (By default, it is set to <code>None</code>.) There are two
      special cases:
        <ol>
          <li>If your <code>AllowOverride</code> setting is <code>All</code>,
          add every directive listed on this page to the list.</li>
          <li>If your <code>AllowOverride</code> setting is <code>None</code>,
          you're done. Only the directives in the <code>AllowOverrideList</code>
          (if any) will be allowed.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>For each override class listed in <code>AllowOverride</code>, look up
      the corresponding set of directives below and add them to the list.</li>
      <li>Finally, add the set of directives that is always allowed in
      .htaccess (these are listed in the
      <a href="#override-all">All section</a>, below).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Several of the override classes are quite powerful and give .htaccess
      users a large amount of control over the server. For a stricter approach,
      set <code>AllowOverride None</code> and use
      <directive module="core">AllowOverrideList</directive> to specify the
      exact list of directives that .htaccess users are allowed to use.
    </p>
  </summary>

  <!--
    Provide one overridesummary element for each Override type. The content will
    be sucked into the relevant section on the override index page.
  -->

  <overridesummary class="All">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in any .htaccess file, as long as
      overrides are enabled in the server configuration.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>

  <overridesummary class="AuthConfig">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in .htaccess files when
      <code>AllowOverride AuthConfig</code> is in effect. They give .htaccess
      users control over the authentication and authorization methods that are
      applied to their directory subtrees, including several related utility
      directives for session handling and TLS settings.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>

  <overridesummary class="FileInfo">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in .htaccess files when
      <code>AllowOverride FileInfo</code> is in effect. They give .htaccess
      users a wide range of control over the responses and metadata given by the
      server.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>

  <overridesummary class="Indexes">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in .htaccess files when
      <code>AllowOverride Indexes</code> is in effect. They allow .htaccess
      users to control aspects of the directory index pages provided by the
      server, including autoindex generation.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>

  <overridesummary class="Limit">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in .htaccess files when
      <code>AllowOverride Limit</code> is in effect. This extremely narrow
      override type mostly allows the use of the legacy authorization directives
      provided by <module>mod_access_compat</module>.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>

  <overridesummary class="Options">
    <p>
      The following directives are allowed in .htaccess files when
      <code>AllowOverride Options</code> is in effect. They give .htaccess
      users access to <code>Options</code> and similar directives, as well as
      directives that control the filter chain.
    </p>
  </overridesummary>
