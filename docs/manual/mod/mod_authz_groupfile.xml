<summary>
    <p>This module provides authorization capabilities so that
    authenticated users can be allowed or denied access to portions
    of the web site by group membership. Similar functionality is
    provided by <module>mod_authz_dbm</module>.</p>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive> directive sets the
    name of a textual file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization. <var>File-path</var> is the path to the group
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the <directive
    module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</p>

    <p>Each line of the group file contains a groupname followed by a
    colon, followed by the member usernames separated by spaces.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      mygroup: bob joe anne
    </example> 

    <p>Note that searching large text files is <em>very</em>
    inefficient; <directive module="mod_authz_dbm"
    >AuthDBMGroupFile</directive> provides a much better performance.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Security</title>
      <p>Make sure that the <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive> is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server; do <em>not</em>
      put it in the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients may
      be able to download the <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive>.</p>
