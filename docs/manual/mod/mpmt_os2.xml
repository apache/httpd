<summary>
    <p>The Server consists of a main, parent process and a small, static
    number of child processes.</p>

    <p>The parent process's job is to manage the child processes. This
    involves spawning children as required to ensure there are always
    <directive module="mpm_common">StartServers</directive> processes
    accepting connections.</p>
    
    <p>Each child process consists of a a pool of worker threads and a
    main thread that accepts connections and passes them to the workers via
    a work queue. The worker thread pool is dynamic, managed by a
    maintenance thread so that the number of idle threads is kept between
    <directive module="mpm_common">MinSpareThreads</directive> and
    <directive module="mpm_common">MaxSpareThreads</directive>.</p>
