<description>FastCGI support module for
<module>mod_proxy</module></description>
<status>Extension</status>
<sourcefile>mod_proxy_fcgi.c</sourcefile>
<identifier>proxy_fcgi_module</identifier>
<compatibility>Available in version 2.3 and later</compatibility>

<summary>
    <p>This module <em>requires</em> the service of <module
    >mod_proxy</module>. It provides support for the
    <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI</a> protocol.</p>

    <p>Thus, in order to get the ability of handling the <code>FastCGI</code>
    protocol, <module>mod_proxy</module> and
    <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> have to be present in the server.</p>

    <p>Unlike <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/">mod_fcgid</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">mod_fastcgi</a>,
    <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> has no provision for starting the
    application process; <program>fcgistarter</program> is provided
    (on some platforms) for that purpose. Alternatively, external launching
    or process management may be available in the FastCGI application
    framework in use.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Warning</title>
      <p>Do not enable proxying until you have <a
      href="mod_proxy.html#access">secured your server</a>. Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large.</p>

<section id="examples"><title>Examples</title>
    <p>Remember, in order to make the following examples work, you have to
    enable <module>mod_proxy</module> and <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module>.</p>

    <example><title>Single application instance</title>
    <highlight language="config">
ProxyPass "/myapp/" "fcgi://localhost:4000/"
    </highlight>
    </example>

    <p> <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> disables connection reuse by
    default, so after a request has been completed the connection will NOT be
    held open by that httpd child process and won't be reused.  If the
    FastCGI application is able to handle concurrent connections
    from httpd, you can opt-in to connection reuse as shown in the following
    example:</p>

    <example><title>Single application instance, connection reuse (2.4.11 and later)</title>
    <highlight language="config">
ProxyPass "/myapp/" "fcgi://localhost:4000/" enablereuse=on
    </highlight>
    </example>

    <p> The following example passes the request URI as a filesystem
    path for the PHP-FPM daemon to run. The request URL is implicitly added
    to the 2nd parameter. The hostname and port following fcgi:// are where
    PHP-FPM is listening.  Connection pooling is enabled.</p>
    <example><title>PHP-FPM</title>
    <highlight language="config">
ProxyPassMatch "^/myapp/.*\.php(/.*)?$" "fcgi://localhost:9000/var/www/" enablereuse=on
    </highlight>
    </example>

    <p> The following example passes the request URI as a filesystem
    path for the PHP-FPM daemon to run. In this case, PHP-FPM is listening on
    a unix domain socket (UDS).  Requires 2.4.9 or later. With this syntax,
    the hostname and optional port following fcgi:// are ignored.</p>
    <example><title>PHP-FPM with UDS</title>
    <highlight language="config">
# UDS does not currently support connection reuse
ProxyPassMatch "^/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$" "unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/var/www/"
    </highlight>
    </example>

    <p>The balanced gateway needs <module>mod_proxy_balancer</module> and
    at least one load balancer algorithm module, such as
    <module>mod_lbmethod_byrequests</module>, in addition to the proxy
    modules listed above.  <module>mod_lbmethod_byrequests</module> is the
    default, and will be used for this example configuration.</p>

    <example><title>Balanced gateway to multiple application instances</title>
    <highlight language="config">
ProxyPass "/myapp/" "balancer://myappcluster/"
&lt;Proxy "balancer://myappcluster/"&gt;
    BalancerMember "fcgi://localhost:4000"
    BalancerMember "fcgi://localhost:4001"
&lt;/Proxy&gt;
    </highlight>
    </example>

      <p>You can also force a request to be handled as a reverse-proxy
        request, by creating a suitable Handler pass-through. The example
        configuration below will pass all requests for PHP scripts to the
        specified FastCGI server using reverse proxy.
        This feature is available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.10 and later. For performance
       reasons, you will want to define a <a href="mod_proxy.html#workers">worker</a>
       representing the same fcgi:// backend. The benefit of this form is that it
       allows the normal mapping of URI to filename to occur in the server, and the
       local filesystem result is passed to the backend.  When FastCGI is
       configured this way, the server can calculate the most accurate
       PATH_INFO.
      </p>
    <example><title>Proxy via Handler</title>
      <highlight language="config">
&lt;FilesMatch "\.php$"&gt;
    # Note: The only part that varies is /path/to/app.sock
    SetHandler  "proxy:unix:/path/to/app.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

# Define a matching worker.
# The part that is matched to the SetHandler is the part that
# follows the pipe. If you need to distinguish, "localhost; can
# be anything unique.
&lt;Proxy "fcgi://localhost/" enablereuse=on max=10&gt;
&lt;/Proxy&gt;

&lt;FilesMatch ...&gt;
    SetHandler  "proxy:fcgi://localhost:9000"
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

&lt;FilesMatch ...&gt;
    SetHandler  "proxy:balancer://myappcluster/"
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
      </highlight>
   </example>

<section id="env"><title>Environment Variables</title>
    <p>In addition to the configuration directives that control the
    behaviour of <module>mod_proxy</module>, there are a number of
    <dfn>environment variables</dfn> that control the FCGI protocol
    provider:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>proxy-fcgi-pathinfo</dt>
        <dd>When configured via <directive module="mod_proxy"
        >ProxyPass</directive> or  <directive module="mod_proxy"
        >ProxyPassMatch</directive>, <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> will not
        set the <var>PATH_INFO</var> environment variable. This allows
        the backend FCGI server to correctly determine <var>SCRIPT_NAME</var>
        and <var>Script-URI</var> and be compliant with RFC 3875 section 3.3.
        If instead you need <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> to generate
        a "best guess" for <var>PATH_INFO</var>, set this env-var.
        This is a workaround for a bug in some FCGI implementations.  This
        variable can be set to multiple values to tweak at how the best guess
        is chosen (In 2.4.11 and later only):
        <dl>
          <dt>first-dot</dt>
          <dd>PATH_INFO is split from the slash following the
              <em>first</em> "." in the URL.</dd>
          <dt>last-dot</dt>
          <dd>PATH_INFO is split from the slash following the
              <em>last</em> "." in the URL.</dd>
          <dt>full</dt>
          <dd>PATH_INFO is calculated by an attempt to map the URL to the
              local filesystem.</dd>
          <dt>unescape</dt>
          <dd>PATH_INFO is the path component of the URL, unescaped /
              decoded.</dd>
          <dt>any other value</dt>
          <dd>PATH_INFO is the same as the path component of the URL.
              Originally, this was the only proxy-fcgi-pathinfo option.</dd>
         </dl>
        </dd>

<name>ProxyFCGIBackendType</name>
<description>Specify the type of backend FastCGI application</description>
<syntax>ProxyFCGIBackendType FPM|GENERIC</syntax>
<default>ProxyFCGIBackendType FPM</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context>
<context>virtual host</context><context>directory</context>
<context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>
<compatibility>Available in version 2.4.26 and later</compatibility>

<usage>
<p>This directive allows the type of backend FastCGI application to be
specified. Some FastCGI servers, such as PHP-FPM,  use historical quirks of
environment variables to identify the type of proxy server being used.  Set
this directive to "GENERIC" if your non PHP-FPM application has trouble
interpreting environment variables such as SCRIPT_FILENAME or PATH_TRANSLATED
as set by the server.</p>

<p>One example of values that change based on the setting of this directive is
SCRIPT_FILENAME. When using <module>mod_proxy_fcgi</module> historically,
SCRIPT_FILENAME was prefixed with the string "proxy:fcgi://". This variable is
what some generic FastCGI applications would read as their script input, but
PHP-FPM would strip the prefix then remember it was talking to Apache.  In
2.4.21 through 2.4.25, this prefix was automatically stripped by the server,
breaking the ability of PHP-FPM to detect and interoperate with Apache in some
scenarios.</p>

<name>ProxyFCGISetEnvIf</name>
<description>Allow variables sent to FastCGI servers to be fixed up</description>
<syntax>ProxyFCGISetEnvIf <var>conditional-expression</var>
    [!]<var>environment-variable-name</var>
    [<var>value-expression</var>]</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context>
<context>virtual host</context><context>directory</context>
<context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>
<compatibility>Available in version 2.4.26 and later</compatibility>

<usage>
<p>Just before passing a request to the configured FastCGI server, the core of
the web server sets a number of environment variables based on details of the
current request. FastCGI programs often uses these environment variables
as inputs that determine what underlying scripts they will process, or what
output they directly produce.</p>
<p>Examples of noteworthy environment variables are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SCRIPT_NAME</li>
  <li>SCRIPT_FILENAME</li>
  <li>REQUEST_URI</li>
  <li>PATH_INFO</li>
  <li>PATH_TRANSLATED</li>
</ul>

<p>This directive allows the environment variables above, or any others of
interest, to be overridden.  This directive is evaluated after the initial
values for these variables are set, so they can be used as input into both
the condition expressions and value expressions.</p>
<p>Parameter syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt>conditional-expression</dt>
<dd>Specifies an expression that controls whether the environment variable that
   follows will be modified.  For information on the expression syntax, see
   the examples that follow or the full specification at the
   <a href="../expr.html">ap_expr</a> documentation.
   </dd>
<dt>environment-variable-name</dt>
<dd> Specifies the CGI environment variable to change,
   such as PATH_INFO. If preceded by an exclamation point, the variable 
   will be unset.</dd>
<dt>value-expression</dt>
<dd>Specifies the replacement value for the preceding environment variable.
   Backreferences, such as "$1", can be included from regular expression
   captures in <var>conditional-expression</var>. If omitted, the variable is
   set (or overridden) to an empty string &mdash; but see the Note below.</dd>
</dl>

<example>
   <highlight language="config">
# A basic, unconditional override
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "true" PATH_INFO "/example"

# Use an environment variable in the value
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "true" PATH_INFO "%{reqenv:SCRIPT_NAME}"

# Use captures in the conditions and backreferences in the replacement
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "reqenv('PATH_TRANSLATED') =~ m|(/.*prefix)(\d+)(.*)|" PATH_TRANSLATED "$1$3"
   </highlight>
</example>

<note><title>Note: Unset vs. Empty</title>
  The following will unset <code>VARIABLE</code>, preventing it from being sent
  to the FastCGI server:

    <highlight language="config">ProxyFCGISetEnvIf true !VARIABLE</highlight>

  Whereas the following will erase any existing <em>value</em> of
  <code>VARIABLE</code> (by setting it to the empty string), but the empty
  <code>VARIABLE</code> will still be sent to the server:

    <highlight language="config">ProxyFCGISetEnvIf true VARIABLE</highlight>

  The CGI/1.1 specification
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875#section-4.1">does not
  distinguish</a> between a variable with an empty value and a variable that
  does not exist. However, many CGI and FastCGI implementations distinguish (or
  allow scripts to distinguish) between the two. The choice of which to use is
  dependent upon your implementation and your reason for modifying the variable.
