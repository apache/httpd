    </note>

    <p><module>mod_proxy</module> and related modules implement a
    proxy/gateway for Apache HTTP Server, supporting a number of popular
    protocols as well as several different load balancing algorithms.
    Third-party modules can add support for additional protocols and
    load balancing algorithms.</p>

    <p>A set of modules must be loaded into the server to provide the
    necessary features.  These modules can be included statically at
    build time or dynamically via the
    <directive module="mod_so">LoadModule</directive> directive).
    The set must include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><module>mod_proxy</module>, which provides basic proxy
      capabilities</li>

      <li><module>mod_proxy_balancer</module> and one or more
      balancer modules, if load balancing is required.  (See 
      <module>mod_proxy_balancer</module> for more information.)</li>

      <li>one or more proxy scheme, or protocol, modules:

        <table border="1">

    <p>In addition, extended features are provided by other modules.
    Caching is provided by <module>mod_cache</module> and related
    modules.  The ability to contact remote servers using the SSL/TLS
    protocol is provided by the <code>SSLProxy*</code> directives of
    <module>mod_ssl</module>.  These additional modules will need
    to be loaded and configured to take advantage of these features.</p>

    <section id="forwardreverse"><title>Forward Proxies and Reverse 
       Proxies/Gateways</title>
      <p>Apache HTTP Server can be configured in both a <dfn>forward</dfn> and
      <dfn>reverse</dfn> proxy (also known as <dfn>gateway</dfn>) mode.</p>

      <p>An ordinary <dfn>forward proxy</dfn> is an intermediate
      server that sits between the client and the <em>origin
      server</em>.  In order to get content from the origin server,
      the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server
      as the target and the proxy then requests the content from the
      origin server and returns it to the client.  The client must be
      specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other
      sites.</p>

      <p>A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet
      access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a
      firewall.  The forward proxy can also use caching (as provided
      by <module>mod_cache</module>) to reduce network usage.</p>

      <p>The forward proxy is activated using the <directive
      module="mod_proxy">ProxyRequests</directive> directive.  Because
      forward proxies allow clients to access arbitrary sites through
      your server and to hide their true origin, it is essential that
      you <a href="#access">secure your server</a> so that only
      authorized clients can access the proxy before activating a
      forward proxy.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>reverse proxy</dfn> (or <dfn>gateway</dfn>), by
      contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web
      server.  No special configuration on the client is necessary.
      The client makes ordinary requests for content in the name-space
      of the reverse proxy.  The reverse proxy then decides where to
      send those requests, and returns the content as if it was itself
      the origin.</p>

      <p>A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet
      users access to a server that is behind a firewall.  Reverse
      proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end
      servers, or to provide caching for a slower back-end server.
      In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring
      several servers into the same URL space.</p>

      <p>A reverse proxy is activated using the <directive
      module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive or the
      <code>[P]</code> flag to the <directive
      module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive> directive.  It is
      <strong>not</strong> necessary to turn <directive
      module="mod_proxy">ProxyRequests</directive> on in order to
      configure a reverse proxy.</p>
    </section> <!-- /forwardreverse -->

    <section id="examples"><title>Basic Examples</title>

    <p>The examples below are only a very basic idea to help you
    get started.  Please read the documentation on the individual
    directives.</p>

    <p>In addition, if you wish to have caching enabled, consult
    the documentation from <module>mod_cache</module>.</p>

    <example><title>Reverse Proxy</title>
    ProxyPass /foo http://foo.example.com/bar<br />
    ProxyPassReverse /foo http://foo.example.com/bar
    </example>

    <example><title>Forward Proxy</title>
    ProxyRequests On<br />
    ProxyVia On<br />
    <br />
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;<br />
    <indent>
      Require host internal.example.com<br />
    </indent>
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;
    </example>
    </section> <!-- /examples -->


    <section id="workers"><title>Workers</title>
      <p>The proxy manages the configuration of origin servers and their
      communication parameters in objects called <dfn>workers</dfn>.
      There are two built-in workers, the default forward proxy worker and the
      default reverse proxy worker. Additional workers can be configured
      explicitly.</p>

      <p>The two default workers have a fixed configuration
      and will be used if no other worker matches the request.
      They do not use HTTP Keep-Alive or connection pooling.
      The TCP connections to the origin server will instead be
      opened and closed for each request.</p>

      <p>Explicitly configured workers are identified by their URL.
      They are usually created and configured using
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> or
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPassMatch</directive> when used
      for a reverse proxy:</p>

      <example>
          ProxyPass /example http://backend.example.com connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
      </example>

      <p>This will create a worker associated with the origin server URL
      <code>http://backend.example.com</code> and using the given timeout
      values. When used in a forward proxy, workers are usually defined
      via the <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxySet</directive> directive:</p>

      <example>
          ProxySet http://backend.example.com connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
      </example>

      <p>or alternatively using <directive module="mod_proxy">Proxy</directive>
      and <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxySet</directive>:</p>

      <example>
        &lt;Proxy http://backend.example.com&gt;<br />
        <indent>
          ProxySet connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
        </indent>
        &lt;/Proxy&gt;
      </example>

      <p>Using explicitly configured workers in the forward mode is
      not very common, because forward proxies usually communicate with many
      different origin servers. Creating explicit workers for some of the
      origin servers can still be useful, if they are used very often.
      Explicitly configured workers have no concept of forward or reverse
      proxying by themselves. They encapsulate a common concept of
      communication with origin servers. A worker created by
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> for use in a
      reverse proxy will be also used for forward proxy requests whenever
      the URL to the origin server matches the worker URL and vice versa.</p>

      <p>The URL identifying a direct worker is the URL of its
      origin server including any path components given:</p>

      <example>
          ProxyPass /examples http://backend.example.com/examples<br />
          ProxyPass /docs http://backend.example.com/docs
      </example>

      <p>This example defines two different workers, each using a separate
      connection pool and configuration.</p>

      <note type="warning"><title>Worker Sharing</title>
        <p>Worker sharing happens if the worker URLs overlap, which occurs when
        the URL of some worker is a leading substring of the URL of another
        worker defined later in the configuration file. In the following example</p>

        <example>
            ProxyPass /apps http://backend.example.com/ timeout=60<br />
            ProxyPass /examples http://backend.example.com/examples timeout=10
        </example>

        <p>the second worker isn't actually created. Instead the first
        worker is used. The benefit is, that there is only one connection pool,
        so connections are more often reused. Note that all configuration attributes
        given explicitly for the later worker will be ignored. This will be logged
        as a warning. In the above example the resulting timeout value
        for the URL <code>/examples</code> will be <code>60</code> instead
        of <code>10</code>!</p>

        <p>If you want to avoid worker sharing, sort your worker definitions
        by URL length, starting with the longest worker URLs. If you want to maximize
        worker sharing use the reverse sort order. See also the related warning about
        ordering <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directives.</p>

      </note> <!-- /worker_sharing -->

      <p>Explicitly configured workers come in two flavors:
      <dfn>direct workers</dfn> and <dfn>(load) balancer workers</dfn>.
      They support many important configuration attributes which are
      described below in the <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive>
      directive. The same attributes can also be set using
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxySet</directive>.</p>

      <p>The set of options available for a direct worker
      depends on the protocol, which is specified in the origin server URL.
      Available protocols include <code>ajp</code>, <code>fcgi</code>,
      <code>ftp</code>, <code>http</code> and <code>scgi</code>.</p>

      <p>Balancer workers are virtual workers that use direct workers known
      as their members to actually handle the requests. Each balancer can
      have multiple members. When it handles a request, it chooses a member
      based on the configured load balancing algorithm.</p>

      <p>A balancer worker is created if its worker URL uses
      <code>balancer</code> as the protocol scheme.
      The balancer URL uniquely identifies the balancer worker.
      Members are added to a balancer using
      <directive module="mod_proxy">BalancerMember</directive>.</p>

    </section> <!-- /workers -->

    <section id="access"><title>Controlling access to your proxy</title>
      <p>You can control who can access your proxy via the <directive
      module="mod_proxy" type="section">Proxy</directive> control block as in
      the following example:</p>

      <example>
        &lt;Proxy *&gt;<br />
        <indent>
          Require ip 192.168.0<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Proxy&gt;
      </example>

      <p>For more information on access control directives, see
      <module>mod_authz_host</module>.</p>

      <p>Strictly limiting access is essential if you are using a
      forward proxy (using the <directive
      module="mod_proxy">ProxyRequests</directive> directive).
      Otherwise, your server can be used by any client to access
      arbitrary hosts while hiding his or her true identity.  This is
      dangerous both for your network and for the Internet at large.
      When using a reverse proxy (using the <directive
      module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive with
      <code>ProxyRequests Off</code>), access control is less
      critical because clients can only contact the hosts that you
      have specifically configured.</p>

      <p><strong>See Also</strong> the <a href="mod_proxy_http.html#env"
      >Proxy-Chain-Auth</a> environment variable.</p>

    </section> <!-- /access -->

    <section id="startup"><title>Slow Startup</title>
      <p>If you're using the <directive module="mod_proxy"
      >ProxyBlock</directive> directive, hostnames' IP addresses are looked up
      and cached during startup for later match test. This may take a few
      seconds (or more) depending on the speed with which the hostname lookups
      occur.</p>
    </section> <!-- /startup -->

    <section id="intranet"><title>Intranet Proxy</title>
      <p>An Apache httpd proxy server situated in an intranet needs to forward
      external requests through the company's firewall (for this, configure
      the <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyRemote</directive> directive
      to forward the respective <var>scheme</var> to the firewall proxy).
      However, when it has to
      access resources within the intranet, it can bypass the firewall when
      accessing hosts. The <directive module="mod_proxy">NoProxy</directive>
      directive is useful for specifying which hosts belong to the intranet and
      should be accessed directly.</p>

      <p>Users within an intranet tend to omit the local domain name from their
      WWW requests, thus requesting "http://somehost/" instead of
      <code>http://somehost.example.com/</code>. Some commercial proxy servers
      let them get away with this and simply serve the request, implying a
      configured local domain. When the <directive module="mod_proxy"
      >ProxyDomain</directive> directive is used and the server is <a
      href="#proxyrequests">configured for proxy service</a>, Apache httpd can return
      a redirect response and send the client to the correct, fully qualified,
      server address. This is the preferred method since the user's bookmark
      files will then contain fully qualified hosts.</p>
    </section> <!-- /intranet -->

    <section id="envsettings"><title>Protocol Adjustments</title>
      <p>For circumstances where <module>mod_proxy</module> is sending
      requests to an origin server that doesn't properly implement
      keepalives or HTTP/1.1, there are two <a
      href="../env.html">environment variables</a> that can force the
      request to use HTTP/1.0 with no keepalive. These are set via the
      <directive module="mod_env">SetEnv</directive> directive.</p>

      <p>These are the <code>force-proxy-request-1.0</code> and
      <code>proxy-nokeepalive</code> notes.</p>

      <example>
        &lt;Location /buggyappserver/&gt;<br />
        <indent>
          ProxyPass http://buggyappserver:7001/foo/<br />
          SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1<br />
          SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Location&gt;
      </example>

    </section> <!-- /envsettings -->

    <section id="request-bodies"><title>Request Bodies</title>

    <p>Some request methods such as POST include a request body.
    The HTTP protocol requires that requests which include a body
    either use chunked transfer encoding or send a
    <code>Content-Length</code> request header.  When passing these
    requests on to the origin server, <module>mod_proxy_http</module>
    will always attempt to send the <code>Content-Length</code>.  But
    if the body is large and the original request used chunked
    encoding, then chunked encoding may also be used in the upstream
    request.  You can control this selection using <a
    href="../env.html">environment variables</a>.  Setting
    <code>proxy-sendcl</code> ensures maximum compatibility with
    upstream servers by always sending the
    <code>Content-Length</code>, while setting
    <code>proxy-sendchunked</code> minimizes resource usage by using
    chunked encoding.</p>

    <p>Under some circumstances, the server must spool request bodies
    to disk to satisfy the requested handling of request bodies.  For 
    example, this spooling will occur if the original body was sent with
    chunked encoding (and is large), but the administrator has
    asked for backend requests to be sent with Content-Length or as HTTP/1.0.
    This spooling can also occur if the request body already has a
    Content-Length header, but the server is configured to filter incoming
    request bodies.</p>

    <p><directive module="core">LimitRequestBody</directive> only applies to
    request bodies that the server will spool to disk</p>

    </section> <!-- /request-bodies -->

    <section id="x-headers"><title>Reverse Proxy Request Headers</title>

    <p>When acting in a reverse-proxy mode (using the <directive
    module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive, for example),
    <module>mod_proxy_http</module> adds several request headers in
    order to pass information to the origin server. These headers
    are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-For</code></dt>
      <dd>The IP address of the client.</dd>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-Host</code></dt>
      <dd>The original host requested by the client in the <code>Host</code> 
       HTTP request header.</dd>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-Server</code></dt>
      <dd>The hostname of the proxy server.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Be careful when using these headers on the origin server, since
    they will contain more than one (comma-separated) value if the
    original request already contained one of these headers. For
    example, you can use <code>%{X-Forwarded-For}i</code> in the log
    format string of the origin server to log the original clients IP
    address, but you may get more than one address if the request
    passes through several proxies.</p>

    <p>See also the <directive
    module="mod_proxy">ProxyPreserveHost</directive> and <directive
    module="mod_proxy">ProxyVia</directive> directives, which control
    other request headers.</p>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>ProxyBadHeader</directive> directive determines the
    behaviour of <module>mod_proxy</module> if it receives syntactically invalid
    response header lines (<em>i.e.</em> containing no colon) from the origin

    <dl>
    <dt><code>IsError</code></dt>
    <dd>Abort the request and end up with a 502 (Bad Gateway) response. This is
    the default behaviour.</dd>

    <dd>Treat bad header lines as if they weren't sent.</dd>

    <dt><code>StartBody</code></dt>
    <dd>When receiving the first bad header line, finish reading the headers and
    treat the remainder as body. This helps to work around buggy backend servers

<syntax>ProxyRemote <var>match</var> <var>remote-server</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This defines remote proxies to this proxy. <var>match</var> is either the
    name of a URL-scheme that the remote server supports, or a partial URL
    for which the remote server should be used, or <code>*</code> to indicate
    the server should be contacted for all requests. <var>remote-server</var> is
    a partial URL for the remote server. Syntax:</p>

    <example>
      <dfn>remote-server</dfn> =
          <var>scheme</var>://<var>hostname</var>[:<var>port</var>]
    </example>

    <p><var>scheme</var> is effectively the protocol that should be used to
    communicate with the remote server; only <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>
    are supported by this module. When using <code>https</code>, the requests
    are forwarded through the remote proxy using the HTTP CONNECT method.</p>

    <example><title>Example</title>
      ProxyRemote http://goodguys.example.com/ http://mirrorguys.example.com:8000<br />
      ProxyRemote * http://cleverproxy.localdomain<br />
      ProxyRemote ftp http://ftpproxy.mydomain:8080
    </example>

    <p>In the last example, the proxy will forward FTP requests, encapsulated
    as yet another HTTP proxy request, to another proxy which can handle
    them.</p>

    <p>This option also supports reverse proxy configuration - a backend
    webserver can be embedded within a virtualhost URL space even if that
    server is hidden by another forward proxy.</p>

<contextlist><context>directory</context>
</contextlist>
<compatibility>BalancerMember is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2

<usage>
    <p>This directive adds a member to a load balancing group. It could be used
    within a <code>&lt;Proxy <var>balancer://</var>...&gt;</code> container
    directive, and can take any of the key value pair parameters available to
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directives.</p>
    <p>One additional parameter is available only to <directive
    module="mod_proxy">BalancerMember</directive> directives:
    <var>loadfactor</var>. This is the member load factor - a number between 1 
    (default) and 100, which defines the weighted load to be applied to the 
    member in question.</p>
    <p>The balancerurl is only needed when not in <code>&lt;Proxy <var>balancer://</var>...&gt;</code>
    container directive. It corresponds to the url of a balancer defined in
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive.</p>

<compatibility>ProxySet is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2
  and later.</compatibility>
<usage>
    <p>This directive is used as an alternate method of setting any of the
    parameters available to Proxy balancers and workers normally done via the
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive. If used
    within a <code>&lt;Proxy <var>balancer url|worker url</var>&gt;</code>
    container directive, the <var>url</var> argument is not required. As a side
    effect the respective balancer or worker gets created. This can be useful
    when doing reverse proxying via a
    <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive> instead of a
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive.</p>

    <example>
      &lt;Proxy balancer://hotcluster&gt;<br />
      <indent>
        BalancerMember http://www2.example.com:8080 loadfactor=1<br />
        BalancerMember http://www3.example.com:8080 loadfactor=2<br />
        ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic<br />
      </indent>
      &lt;/Proxy&gt;
    </example>

    <example>
      &lt;Proxy http://backend&gt;<br />
      <indent>
        ProxySet keepalive=On<br />
      </indent>
      &lt;/Proxy&gt;
    </example>

    <example>
        ProxySet balancer://foo lbmethod=bytraffic timeout=15
    </example>

    <example>
        ProxySet ajp://backend:7001 timeout=15
    </example>

   <note type="warning"><title>Warning</title>
      <p>Keep in mind that the same parameter key can have a different meaning
      depending whether it is applied to a balancer or a worker as shown by the two
      examples above regarding timeout.</p>

<name>ProxyPass</name>
<description>Maps remote servers into the local server URL-space</description>
<syntax>ProxyPass [<var>path</var>] !|<var>url</var> [<var>key=value</var>
  <var>[key=value</var> ...]] [nocanon] [interpolate]</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive allows remote servers to be mapped into the
    space of the local server; the local server does not act as a
    proxy in the conventional sense, but appears to be a mirror of the
    remote server. The local server is often called a <dfn>reverse
    proxy</dfn> or <dfn>gateway</dfn>. The <var>path</var> is the name of
    a local virtual path; <var>url</var> is a partial URL for the
    remote server and cannot include a query string.</p>

    <note type="warning">The <directive
    module="mod_proxy">ProxyRequests</directive> directive should
    usually be set <strong>off</strong> when using
    <directive>ProxyPass</directive>.</note>

    <p>Suppose the local server has address <code>http://example.com/</code>;
    then</p>

    <example>
        &lt;Location /mirror/foo/&gt;<br />
        <indent>
          ProxyPass http://backend.example.com/<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    </example>

    <p>will cause a local request for
    <code>http://example.com/mirror/foo/bar</code> to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to <code>http://backend.example.com/bar</code>.</p>

    <p>The following alternative syntax is possible, however carries a
    performance penalty when present in large numbers:</p>

    <example>
        ProxyPass /mirror/foo/ http://backend.example.com/
    </example>
    
    <note type="warning">
    <p>If the first argument ends with a trailing <strong>/</strong>, the second
       argument should also end with a trailing <strong>/</strong> and vice
       versa. Otherwise the resulting requests to the backend may miss some
       needed slashes and do not deliver the expected results.
    </p>
    </note>

    <p>The <code>!</code> directive is useful in situations where you don't want
    to reverse-proxy a subdirectory, <em>e.g.</em></p>

    <example>
        &lt;Location /mirror/foo/&gt;<br />
        <indent>
          ProxyPass http://backend.example.com/<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;Location /mirror/foo/i&gt;<br />
        <indent>
            ProxyPass !<br />
        </indent>
        &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    </example>

    <example>
      ProxyPass /mirror/foo/i !<br />
      ProxyPass /mirror/foo http://backend.example.com
    </example>

    <p>will proxy all requests to <code>/mirror/foo</code> to
    <code>backend.example.com</code> <em>except</em> requests made to
    <code>/mirror/foo/i</code>.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Ordering ProxyPass Directives</title>
      <p>The configured <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive>
      and <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPassMatch</directive>
      rules are checked in the order of configuration. The first rule that
      matches wins. So usually you should sort conflicting
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> rules starting with the
      longest URLs first. Otherwise later rules for longer URLS will be hidden
      by any earlier rule which uses a leading substring of the URL. Note that
      there is some relation with worker sharing. In contrast, only one
      <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive can be placed
      in a <directive module="core">Location</directive> block, and the most
      specific location will take precedence.</p>

      <p>For the same reasons exclusions must come <em>before</em> the
      general <directive>ProxyPass</directive> directives.</p>

    </note> <!-- /ordering_proxypass -->

    <p>In Apache HTTP Server 2.1 and later, mod_proxy supports pooled
    connections to a backend server.  Connections created on demand
    can be retained in a pool for future use.  Limits on the pool size
    and other settings can be coded on
    the <directive>ProxyPass</directive> directive
    using  <code>key=value</code> parameters, described in the table
    below.</p>

    <p>By default, mod_proxy will allow and retain the maximum number of
    connections that could be used simultaneously by that web server child
    process.  Use the <code>max</code> parameter to reduce the number from
    the default.  Use the <code>ttl</code> parameter to set an optional
    time to live; connections which have been unused for at least
    <code>ttl</code> seconds will be closed.  <code>ttl</code> can be used
    to avoid using a connection which is subject to closing because of the
    backend server's keep-alive timeout.</p>

    <p>The pool of connections is maintained per web server child
    process, and <code>max</code> and other settings are not coordinated 
    among all child processes, except when only one child process is allowed
    by configuration or MPM design.</p>

    <p>Normally, mod_proxy will canonicalise ProxyPassed URLs.
    But this may be incompatible with some backends, particularly those
    that make use of <var>PATH_INFO</var>.  The optional <var>nocanon</var>
    keyword suppresses this, and passes the URL path "raw" to the
    backend.  Note that may affect the security of your backend, as it
    removes the normal limited protection against URL-based attacks
    provided by the proxy.</p>

    <p>The optional <var>interpolate</var> keyword (available in
    httpd 2.2.9 and later), in combination with
    <directive>ProxyPassInterpolateEnv</directive> causes the ProxyPass
    to interpolate environment variables, using the syntax
    <var>${VARNAME}</var>.  Note that many of the standard CGI-derived
    environment variables will not exist when this interpolation happens,
    so you may still have to resort to <module>mod_rewrite</module>
    for complex rules.</p>

    <p>When used inside a <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Location</directive> section, the first argument is omitted and the local
    directory is obtained from the <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Location</directive>. The same will occur inside a
    <directive type="section" module="core">LocationMatch</directive> section,
    however ProxyPass does not interpret the regexp as such, so it is necessary
    to use <directive>ProxyPassMatch</directive> in this situation instead.</p>

<usage>
    <p>This directive is equivalent to <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive>,
       but makes use of regular expressions, instead of simple prefix matching. The
       supplied regular expression is matched against the <var>url</var>, and if it
       matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized matches into the given
       string and use it as a new <var>url</var>.</p>

    <p>Suppose the local server has address <code>http://example.com/</code>;
    then</p>

    <example>
      ProxyPassMatch ^(/.*\.gif)$ http://backend.example.com$1
    </example>

    <p>will cause a local request for
    <code>http://example.com/foo/bar.gif</code> to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to <code>http://backend.example.com/foo/bar.gif</code>.</p>
    <note><title>Note</title>
      <p>The URL argument must be parsable as a URL <em>before</em> regexp
      substitutions (as well as after).  This limits the matches you can use.
      For instance, if we had used</p>
      <example>
        ProxyPassMatch ^(/.*\.gif)$ http://backend.example.com:8000$1
      </example>
      <p>in our previous example, it would fail with a syntax error
      at server startup.  This is a bug (PR 46665 in the ASF bugzilla),
      and the workaround is to reformulate the match:</p>
      <example>
        ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.gif)$ http://backend.example.com:8000/$1
      </example>

<name>ProxyPassReverse</name>
<description>Adjusts the URL in HTTP response headers sent from a reverse
proxied server</description>
<syntax>ProxyPassReverse [<var>path</var>] <var>url</var>
[<var>interpolate</var>]</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive lets Apache httpd adjust the URL in the <code>Location</code>,
    <code>Content-Location</code> and <code>URI</code> headers on HTTP
    redirect responses. This is essential when Apache httpd is used as a
    reverse proxy (or gateway) to avoid by-passing the reverse proxy
    because of HTTP redirects on the backend servers which stay behind
    the reverse proxy.</p>

    <p>Only the HTTP response headers specifically mentioned above
    will be rewritten. Apache httpd will not rewrite other response
    headers, nor will it rewrite URL references inside HTML pages.
    This means that if the proxied content contains absolute URL
    references, they will by-pass the proxy.  A third-party module
    that will look inside the HTML and rewrite URL references is Nick
    Kew's <a href="http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/"
    >mod_proxy_html</a>.</p>

    <p><var>path</var> is the name of a local virtual path. <var>url</var> is a
    partial URL for the remote server - the same way they are used for the
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyPass</directive> directive.</p>

    <p>For example, suppose the local server has address
    <code>http://example.com/</code>; then</p>

    <example>
      ProxyPass         /mirror/foo/ http://backend.example.com/<br />
      ProxyPassReverse  /mirror/foo/ http://backend.example.com/<br />
      ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain  backend.example.com  public.example.com<br />
      ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  /  /mirror/foo/
    </example>

    <p>will not only cause a local request for the
    <code>http://example.com/mirror/foo/bar</code> to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to <code>http://backend.example.com/bar</code>
    (the functionality <code>ProxyPass</code> provides here). It also takes care
    of redirects the server <code>backend.example.com</code> sends: when
    <code>http://backend.example.com/bar</code> is redirected by him to
    <code>http://backend.example.com/quux</code> Apache httpd adjusts this to
    <code>http://example.com/mirror/foo/quux</code> before forwarding the HTTP
    redirect response to the client. Note that the hostname used for
    constructing the URL is chosen in respect to the setting of the <directive
    module="core">UseCanonicalName</directive> directive.</p>

    <p>Note that this <directive>ProxyPassReverse</directive> directive can
    also be used in conjunction with the proxy pass-through feature
    (<code>RewriteRule ...  [P]</code>) from <module>mod_rewrite</module>
    because it doesn't depend on a corresponding <directive module="mod_proxy"
    >ProxyPass</directive> directive.</p>

    <p>The optional <var>interpolate</var> keyword (available in
    httpd 2.2.9 and later), used together with
    <directive>ProxyPassInterpolateEnv</directive>, enables interpolation
    of environment variables specified using the format <var>${VARNAME}</var>.
    </p>

    <p>When used inside a <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Location</directive> section, the first argument is omitted and the local
    directory is obtained from the <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Location</directive>. The same occurs inside a <directive type="section"
    module="core">LocationMatch</directive> section, but will probably not work as
    intended, as ProxyPassReverse will interpret the regexp literally as a
    path; if needed in this situation, specify the ProxyPassReverse outside
    the section, or in a separate <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Location</directive> section.</p>

    <p>This directive is not supported in <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Directory</directive> or <directive type="section" module="core"
    >Files</directive> sections.</p>

    setting <code>Max-Forwards</code> if the Client didn't set it.
    Earlier Apache httpd versions would always set it.  A negative

<usage>
    <p>This directive is only useful for Apache httpd proxy servers within
    intranets.  The <directive>NoProxy</directive> directive specifies a
    list of subnets, IP addresses, hosts and/or domains, separated by
    spaces. A request to a host which matches one or more of these is
    always served directly, without forwarding to the configured
    <directive module="mod_proxy">ProxyRemote</directive> proxy server(s).</p>

    <example><title>Example</title>
      ProxyRemote  *  http://firewall.example.com:81<br />
      NoProxy         .example.com 192.168.112.0/21
    </example>

    <p>The <var>host</var> arguments to the <directive>NoProxy</directive>
    directive are one of the following type list:</p>

    <dl>
    <!-- ===================== Domain ======================= -->
    <dt><var><a name="domain" id="domain">Domain</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>Domain</dfn> is a partially qualified DNS domain name, preceded
    by a period. It represents a list of hosts which logically belong to the
    same DNS domain or zone (<em>i.e.</em>, the suffixes of the hostnames are
    all ending in <var>Domain</var>).</p>

    <example><title>Examples</title>
      .com .example.org.
    </example>

    <p>To distinguish <var>Domain</var>s from <var><a href="#hostname"
    >Hostname</a></var>s (both syntactically and semantically; a DNS domain can
    have a DNS A record, too!), <var>Domain</var>s are always written with a
    leading period.</p>
    
    <note><title>Note</title>
      <p>Domain name comparisons are done without regard to the case, and
      <var>Domain</var>s are always assumed to be anchored in the root of the
      DNS tree, therefore two domains <code>.ExAmple.com</code> and
      <code>.example.com.</code> (note the trailing period) are considered
      equal. Since a domain comparison does not involve a DNS lookup, it is much
      more efficient than subnet comparison.</p>
    </note></dd>

    <!-- ===================== SubNet ======================= -->
    <dt><var><a name="subnet" id="subnet">SubNet</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>SubNet</dfn> is a partially qualified internet address in
    numeric (dotted quad) form, optionally followed by a slash and the netmask,
    specified as the number of significant bits in the <var>SubNet</var>. It is
    used to represent a subnet of hosts which can be reached over a common
    network interface. In the absence of the explicit net mask it is assumed
    that omitted (or zero valued) trailing digits specify the mask. (In this
    case, the netmask can only be multiples of 8 bits wide.) Examples:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt><code>192.168</code> or <code>192.168.0.0</code></dt>
    <dd>the subnet 192.168.0.0 with an implied netmask of 16 valid bits
    (sometimes used in the netmask form <code>255.255.0.0</code>)</dd>
    <dt><code>192.168.112.0/21</code></dt>
    <dd>the subnet <code>192.168.112.0/21</code> with a netmask of 21
    valid bits (also used in the form <code>255.255.248.0</code>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>As a degenerate case, a <em>SubNet</em> with 32 valid bits is the
    equivalent to an <var><a href="#ipadr">IPAddr</a></var>, while a <var>SubNet</var> with zero
    valid bits (<em>e.g.</em>, 0.0.0.0/0) is the same as the constant
    <var>_Default_</var>, matching any IP address.</p></dd>

    <!-- ===================== IPAddr ======================= -->
    <dt><var><a name="ipaddr" id="ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>IPAddr</dfn> represents a fully qualified internet address in
    numeric (dotted quad) form. Usually, this address represents a host, but
    there need not necessarily be a DNS domain name connected with the
    address.</p>
    <example><title>Example</title>
      192.168.123.7
    </example>
    
    <note><title>Note</title>
      <p>An <var>IPAddr</var> does not need to be resolved by the DNS system, so
      it can result in more effective apache performance.</p>
    </note></dd>

    <!-- ===================== Hostname ======================= -->
    <dt><var><a name="hostname" id="hostname">Hostname</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>Hostname</dfn> is a fully qualified DNS domain name which can
    be resolved to one or more <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddrs</a></var> via the
    DNS domain name service. It represents a logical host (in contrast to
    <var><a href="#domain">Domain</a></var>s, see above) and must be resolvable
    to at least one <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var> (or often to a list
    of hosts with different <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var>s).</p>

    <example><title>Examples</title>
      prep.ai.example.edu<br />
      www.example.org
    </example>

    <note><title>Note</title>
      <p>In many situations, it is more effective to specify an <var><a
      href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var> in place of a <var>Hostname</var> since a
      DNS lookup can be avoided. Name resolution in Apache httpd can take a remarkable
      deal of time when the connection to the name server uses a slow PPP
      link.</p>
      <p><var>Hostname</var> comparisons are done without regard to the case,
      and <var>Hostname</var>s are always assumed to be anchored in the root
      of the DNS tree, therefore two hosts <code>WWW.ExAmple.com</code>
      and <code>www.example.com.</code> (note the trailing period) are
      considered equal.</p>

    Error message).</p>
