<section id="traffic">
    <title>Weighted Traffic Counting Algorithm</title>
    <p>Enabled via <code>lbmethod=bytraffic</code>, the idea behind this
    scheduler is very similar to the Request Counting method, with
    the following changes:</p>

    <p><dfn>lbfactor</dfn> is <em>how much traffic, in bytes, we want
    this worker to handle</em>. This is also a normalized value
    representing their "share" of the amount of work to be done,
    but instead of simply counting the number of requests, we take
    into account the amount of traffic this worker has seen.</p>

    <p>If a balancer is configured as follows:</p>
    
    <table style="data">
    <tr><th>worker</th>
        <th>a</th>
        <th>b</th>
        <th>c</th></tr>
    <tr><th>lbfactor</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Then we mean that we want <var>b</var> to process twice the
    amount of bytes than <var>a</var> or <var>c</var> should. It does
    not necessarily mean that <var>b</var> would handle twice as
    many requests, but it would process twice the I/O. Thus, the
    size of the request and response are applied to the weighting
    and selection algorithm.</p>
