<description>Multi-Processing Module implementing an exclusively threaded web

<summary>
    <p>This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) implements an exclusively
    threaded web server that has been optimized for Novell
    NetWare.</p>

    <p>The main thread is responsible for launching child
    worker threads which listen for connections and serve them when they
    arrive. Apache always tries to maintain several <em>spare</em>
    or idle worker threads, which stand ready to serve incoming
    requests. In this way, clients do not need to wait for a new
    child threads to be spawned before their requests can be
    served.</p>

    <p>The <code>StartThreads</code>, <code>MinSpareThreads</code>,
    <code>MaxSpareThreads</code>, and <code>MaxThreads</code>
    regulate how the main thread creates worker threads to serve
    requests. In general, Apache is very self-regulating, so most
    sites do not need to adjust these directives from their default
    values. Sites which need to serve more than 250 simultaneous
    requests may need to increase <code>MaxThreads</code>, while
    sites with limited memory may need to decrease
    <code>MaxThreads</code> to keep the server from thrashing (spawning and
    terminating idle threads). More information about
    tuning process creation is provided in the <a
    href="../misc/perf-tuning.html">performance hints</a>
    documentation.</p>

    <p><code>MaxRequestsPerChild</code> controls how frequently the
    server recycles processes by killing old ones and launching new
    ones.&nbsp; On the NetWare OS it is highly recommended that this directive
    remain set to 0.&nbsp; This allows worker threads to continue servicing
    requests indefinitely.</p>

    ports Apache uses</a>.</p>

<usage>
    <p>This directive tells the server what stack size to use for
    each of the running threads. If you ever get a stack overflow
    you will need to bump this number to a higher setting.</p>
