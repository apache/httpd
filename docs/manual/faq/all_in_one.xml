<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

<summary>
    <p>The latest version of this FAQ is always available from the main Apache
    web site, at &lt;<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/&httpd.docs;/faq/"
    >http://httpd.apache.org/docs/&httpd.docs;/faq/</a>&gt;.</p>

    <p>Since Apache 2.0 is quite new, we don't yet know what the <em>Frequently
    Asked Questions</em> will be. While this section fills up, you should also
    consult the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">Apache 1.3
    FAQ</a> to see if your question is answered there.</p>
