<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

<summary>
    <p>The latest version of this FAQ is always available from the
    main Apache web site, at &lt;<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/faq/"
    >http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/faq/</a>&gt;. In addition, you can view
    this FAQ <a href="all_in_one.html">all in one page</a> for easy searching
    and printing.</p>

    <p>Since Apache 2.0 is quite new, we don't yet know what the
    <em>Frequently Asked Questions</em> will be. While this section fills up,
    you should also consult the <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">Apache 1.3 FAQ</a> to see
    if your question is answered there.</p>
