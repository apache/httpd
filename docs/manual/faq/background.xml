      <title>How thoroughly tested is Apache?</title>
      <p>Apache is run on millions of Internet servers.
      It has been tested thoroughly by both developers and users. The Apache
      HTTP Server Project maintains rigorous standards before releasing new 
      versions of our server, and our server runs without a hitch on over 
      70% of all WWW servers available on the Internet. When bugs do show 
      up, we release patches and new versions as soon as they are
      available.</p>
