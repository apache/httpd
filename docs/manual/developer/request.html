    <h1>Request Processing in Apache 2.0</h1>

    <p>Warning - this is a first (fast) draft that needs further
    revision!</p>

    <p>Several changes in Apache 2.0 affect the internal request
    processing mechanics. Module authors need to be aware of these
    changes so they may take advantage of the optimizations and
    security enhancements.</p>

    <p>The first major change is to the subrequest and redirect
    mechanisms. There were a number of different code paths in
    Apache 1.3 to attempt to optimize subrequest or redirect
    behavior. As patches were introduced to 2.0, these
    optimizations (and the server behavior) were quickly broken due
    to this duplication of code. All duplicate code has been folded
    back into <code>ap_process_internal_request()</code> to prevent
    the code from falling out of sync again.</p>

    <p>This means that much of the existing code was 'unoptimized'.
    It is the Apache HTTP Project's first goal to create a robust
    and correct implementation of the HTTP server RFC. Additional
    goals include security, scalability and optimization. New
    methods were sought to optimize the server (beyond the
    performance of Apache 1.3) without introducing fragile or
    insecure code.</p>

    <h2>The Request Processing Cycle</h2>

    <p>All requests pass through
    <code>ap_process_request_internal()</code> in request.c,
    including subrequests and redirects. If a module doesn't pass
    generated requests through this code, the author is cautioned
    that the module may be broken by future changes to request
    processing.</p>

    <p>To streamline requests, the module author can take advantage
    of the hooks offered to drop out of the request cycle early, or
    to bypass core Apache hooks which are irrelevant (and costly in
    terms of CPU.)</p>

    <h2>The Request Parsing Phase</h2>

    <h3>Unescapes the URL</h3>

    <p>The request's parsed_uri path is unescaped, once and only
    once, at the beginning of internal request processing.</p>

    <p>This step is bypassed if the proxyreq flag is set, or the
    parsed_uri.path element is unset. The module has no further
    control of this one-time unescape operation, either failing to
    unescape or multiply unescaping the URL leads to security
    reprecussions.</p>

    <h3>Strips Parent and This Elements from the URI</h3>

    <p>All <code>/../</code> and <code>/./</code> elements are
    removed by <code>ap_getparents()</code>. This helps to ensure
    the path is (nearly) absolute before the request processing
    continues.</p>

    <p>This step cannot be bypassed.</p>

    <h3>Initial URI Location Walk</h3>

    <p>Every request is subject to an
    <code>ap_location_walk()</code> call. This ensures that
    &lt;Location &gt; sections are consistently enforced for all
    requests. If the request is an internal redirect or a
    sub-request, it may borrow some or all of the processing from
    the previous or parent request's ap_location_walk, so this step
    is generally very efficient after processing the main
    request.</p>

    <h3>Hook: translate_name</h3>

    <p>Modules can determine the file name, or alter the given URI
    in this step. For example, mod_vhost_alias will translate the
    URI's path into the configured virtual host, mod_alias will
    translate the path to an alias path, and if the request falls
    back on the core, the DocumentRoot is prepended to the request
    resource.</p>

    <p>If all modules DECLINE this phase, an error 500 is returned
    to the browser, and a "couldn't translate name" error is logged
    automatically.</p>

    <h3>Hook: map_to_storage</h3>

    <p>After the file or correct URI was determined, the
    appropriate per-dir configurations are merged together. For
    example, mod_proxy compares and merges the appropriate
    &lt;Proxy &gt; sections. If the URI is nothing more than a
    local (non-proxy) TRACE request, the core handles the request
    and returns DONE. If no module answers this hook with OK or
    DONE, the core will run the request filename against the
    &lt;Directory &gt; and &lt;Files &gt; sections. If the request
    'filename' isn't an absolute, legal filename, a note is set for
    later termination.</p>

    <h3>Initial URI Location Walk</h3>

    <p>Every request is hardened by a second
    <code>ap_location_walk()</code> call. This reassures that a
    translated request is still subjected to the configured
    &lt;Location &gt; sections. The request again borrows some or
    all of the processing from its previous location_walk above,
    so this step is almost always very efficient unless the
    translated URI mapped to a substantially different path or
    Virtual Host.</p>

    <h3>Hook: header_parser</h3>

    <p>The main request then parses the client's headers. This
    prepares the remaining request processing steps to better serve
    the client's request.</p>

    case SATISFY_NOSPEC:

            return decl_die(access_status, "check access", r);

            }
            }
        break;
    }
</pre>

    <h2>The Preparation Phase</h2>

    <h3>Hook: type_checker</h3>

    <p>The modules have an opportunity to test the URI or filename
    against the target resource, and set mime information for the
    request. Both mod_mime and mod_mime_magic use this phase to
    compare the file name or contents against the administrator's
    configuration and set the content type, language, character set
    and request handler. Some modules may set up their filters or
    other request handling parameters at this time.</p>

    <p>If all modules DECLINE this phase, an error 500 is returned
    to the browser, and a "couldn't find types" error is logged
    automatically.</p>

    <h3>Hook: fixups</h3>

    <p>Many modules are 'trounced' by some phase above. The fixups
    phase is used by modules to 'reassert' their ownership or force
    the request's fields to their appropriate values. It isn't
    always the cleanest mechanism, but occasionally it's the only
    option.</p>

    <h2>The Handler Phase</h2>

    <p>This phase is <strong><em>not</em></strong> part of the
    processing in <code>ap_process_request_internal()</code>. Many
    modules prepare one or more subrequests prior to creating any
    content at all. After the core, or a module calls
    <code>ap_process_request_internal()</code> it then calls
    <code>ap_invoke_handler()</code> to generate the request.</p>

    <h3>Hook: insert_filter</h3>

    <p>Modules that transform the content in some way can insert
    their values and override existing filters, such that if the
    user configured a more advanced filter out-of-order, then the
    module can move its order as need be.  There is no result code,
    so actions in this hook better be trusted to always succeed.</p>

    <h3>Hook: handler</h3>

    <p>The module finally has a chance to serve the request in its
    handler hook. Note that not every prepared request is sent to
    the handler hook. Many modules, such as mod_autoindex, will
    create subrequests for a given URI, and then never serve the
    subrequest, but simply lists it for the user. Remember not to
    put required teardown from the hooks above into this module,
    but register pool cleanups against the request pool to free
    resources as required.</p>
