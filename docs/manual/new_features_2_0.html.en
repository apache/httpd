<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Unix Threading</STRONG>
<DD>On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache can now run in a
    hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This should improve
    scalability. 

<DT><STRONG>New Build System</STRONG>
<DD>The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be based on
    autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache's configuration system more
    similar to that of other packages.

<DT><STRONG>Multiprotocol Support</STRONG>
<DD>Apache now has some of the infrastructure in place to support serving
    multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written as an example.

<DT><STRONG>Better support for non-Unix platforms</STRONG> <DD>Apache
    2.0 is faster and more stable on non-Unix platforms such as BeOS,
    OS/2, and Windows. With the introduction of platform-specific <a
    href="mpm.html">multi-processing modules</a> (MPMs) and the Apache
    Portable Runtime (APR), these platforms are now implemented in their
    native API, avoiding the often buggy and poorly performing
    POSIX-emulation layers.

<DT><STRONG>New Apache API</STRONG>
<DD>The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0. Many of the
    module-ordering problems from 1.3 should be gone. 2.0 does much of
    this automatically, and module ordering is now done per-hook to
    allow more flexibility. Also, new calls have been added that provide
    additional module capabilities without patching the core Apache server.
