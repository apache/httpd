If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to docs-subscribe@httpd.apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and

tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

Things That Need Fixing
=======================

- XML
    - Rewriting of the remainder of the manual into xml is in
      progress.  See the bottom of this file for status info.
    - Get mod/mod_auth_ldap.xml to validate against the current dtd.
    - Some of the nested <dl>s in mod/mod_include.xml are not working
      in mozilla.  Probably enclosing some of the bare paragraphs
      in <p> would fix it.
    - add ids to non-directive sections of the module docs, so they
      get a chance to be linked in the sidebar

- Windows platform docs are in desperate need of rewrites/updates for 2.0.
    - Bill Rowe and Bill Stoddard are good contacts for tech questions.

- New Auth system
    - With the new auth system, we have a bunch of directives that are
      duplicated in multiple modules, where one of the modules is obsolete.
      We probably need to mark the old modules as <status>obsolete</status>
      and key on that to omit them from the directive index, etc.
    - Much clean-up and enhancement of docs
    - Independent note on how to upgrade to new auth system

- Figure out what to do about the 2.0 FAQ
    - Copy important stuff from 1.3?
    - Some kind of XML?
    - Something that allows dynamic contributions from users a la
      FAQ-O-Matic?  (I don't think any really good software exists 
      for this.)

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    
- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0. 
      Presently, these are generated from nroff man pages using
      the program in the site-tools repository, but nobody seems
      willing to update the nroff files at the moment.
      What should we do?

      - we should be able to setup an XSLT to convert XML to nroff,
        shouldn't we? --nd
        - Theoretically?  Yes.  ;-) --Joshua

- MPM documentation
     - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
     - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

- Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
     - misc/custom_errordocs.html needs to be updated to
       essentially describe how the international error
       docs included in 2.0 work
     - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
     - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
     - misc/stopping.html
     - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
     - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, it is basically
      accurate, but very incomplete.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    There are several efforts underway to translate the documentation
    into other languages. A detailed list of the currently known
    translators (and the corresponding websites) can be found at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/translations.html


Documentation improvements
==========================

* New user docs: Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

* Enhancements to the DTD/XSL:
  - <glossary> tag that links to the glossary and uses some special 
    style in the css.
  - <parentdocument href="...">...</parentdocument> tag to give some
    more structure for the cookie-crumbs, etc.
  - New index: directives by context, including listing which directives
    are available for each AllowOverride setting.
  - Add a quickreference.html that contains summary info on each
    directive.
    - Joshua is working on this
  - Use a tag like <var> in place of <em> for things like the 
    <syntax> listing.
    - nd volunteers
  - Use the sitemap.xml in place of allmodules.xml to generate the
    directives.html and mod/index.html.
  - Handle more levels of sub<section>s.
  - add letter links to glossary, perhaps also a term overview (sidebar)

* Autogeneration of PDF
  - FOP?

* Windows help file
  - David Shane Holden was working on this

* Improving the "security docs"
  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

XML Conversions
===============

The following files need to be converted to XML as described at
