If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and
http://apache-server.com/tutorials/ATdocs-project.html for an excellent
tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

- XML
    - The xsl transformations could be greatly improved to a) look better
      and b) use proper CSS+html rather than the horrible hack that
      Joshua did (in progress).
    - Rewriting of the remainder of the manual into xml is in
      progress.  See the bottom of this file for status info.

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    
- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0.  At least
      the httpd man page appears to be outdated, and perhaps other.
      After this is done, the manual/programs/ versions can be
      regenerated using the program in the site-tools repository.

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.
          - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
          - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
        Status:  What docs still need to be touched here?
                 - misc/custom_errordocs.html needs to be updated to
                   essentially describe how the international error
                   docs included in 2.0 work
                 - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
                 - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
                 - misc/stopping.html
                 - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
                 - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, but many things have
      changed in the build system since it was written.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    There are several efforts underway to translate the documentation
    into other languages. A detailed list of the currently known
    translators (and the corresponding websites) can be found at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/translations.html

New User documentation
======================

* Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

Documentation improvements
==========================

* Improving the "security docs"

  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

* regex: We should at least document someplace what regex library we
  are using and how to find more information about it

XML Conversions

The following files need to be converted to XML as described at
