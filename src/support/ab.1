.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ab
is a tool for benchmarking your Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
server. It is designed to give you an impression on how performant is your
current Apache installation.  This especially shows you how much requests per
time your Apache installation is capable to serve. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B \-k 
Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature, i.e. perform multiple requests within one
HTTP session instead. Default is no KeepAlive.
.TP 12
.BI \-n " requests"
Number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session.  The default is to
just perform one single request which usually leads to not very representative
benchmarking results.
.TP 12
.BI \-t " timelimit"
Seconds to max. spend for benchmarking. This implies
a 
.B \-n 
.B 50000
internally. Use this to benchmark the server within a fixed total amount of
time.  Per default there is no timelimit. 
.TP 12
.BI \-c " concurrency"
Number of multiple requests per time to perform. 
Default is one request per time.
