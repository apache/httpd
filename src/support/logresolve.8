.SH NAME
logresolve \- resolve hostnames for IP-adresses in Apache logfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B logresolve
is a post-processing program to resolve IP-adresses in Apache's access
logfiles.  To minimize impact on your nameserver, logresolve has its very own
internal hash-table cache. This means that each IP number will only be looked
up the first time it is found in the log file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.BI \-s " filename"
Specifies a filename to record statistics.
.TP 12
.B \-c 
This causes 
.B logresolve 
to apply some DNS checks: after finding the hostname from the IP address, it
looks up the IP addresses for the hostname and checks that one of these
matches the original address.
