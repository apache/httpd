  <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_mmap_static</H1>

  <P>
  This module is contained in the <CODE>mod_mmap_static.c</CODE> file, with
  Apache 1.3 and later. It provides mmap()ing of a statically configured list
  of frequently requested but not changed files.  It is not compiled into the
  server by default. To use <CODE>mod_mmap_static</CODE> you have to enable
  the following line in the server build <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file:
  <PRE>
    AddModule  modules/experimental/mod_mmap_static.o
  </PRE>
  </P>

  <H2>Summary</H2>
  <P>
  This is an <STRONG>experimental</STRONG> module and should be used with
  care.  You can easily create a broken site using this module, read this
  document carefully.
  <code>mod_mmap_static</code> maps a list of statically configured files (via
  <CODE>MMapFile</CODE> directives in the main server configuration) into
  memory through the system call <CODE>mmap()</CODE>.  This system
  call is available on most modern Unix derivates, but not on all.  There
  are sometimes system-specific limits on the size and number of files that
  can be mmap()d, experimentation is probably the easiest way to find out.
  </P>
  <P>
  This mmap()ing is done once at server start or restart, only. So whenever
  one of the mapped files changes on the filesystem you <EM>have</EM> to
  restart the server by at least sending it a HUP or USR1 signal (see the
  <a href="../stopping.html">Stopping and Restarting</a> documentation).  To
  reiterate that point:  if the files are modified <EM>in place</EM> without
  restarting the server you may end up serving requests that are completely
  bogus.  You should update files by unlinking the old copy and putting a new
  copy in place. Most tools such as <CODE>rdist</CODE> and <CODE>mv</CODE> do
  this. The reason why this modules doesn't take care of changes to the files
  is that this check would need an extra <CODE>stat()</CODE> every time which
  is a waste and against the intent of I/O reduction.

  <P>
  The <CODE>MMapFile</CODE> directive maps one or more files (given as
  whitespace separated arguments) into memory at server startup time.  They
  are automatically unmapped on a server shutdown. When the files have changed
  on the filesystem at least a HUP or USR1 signal should be send to the server
  to re-mmap them.
  </P>

  <P>
  Be careful with the <EM>filename</EM> arguments: They have to literally
  match the filesystem path Apache's URL-to-filename translation handlers
  create. We cannot compare inodes or other stuff to match paths through
  symbolic links etc. because that again would cost extra <CODE>stat()</CODE>
  system calls which is not acceptable.  This module may or may not work
  with filenames rewritten by <code>mod_alias</code> or
  <code>mod_rewrite</code>... it is an experiment after all.
  </P>

  <P>
  Notice: You cannot use this for speeding up CGI programs or other files
  which are served by special content handlers. It can only be used for
  regular files which are usually served by the Apache core content handler.
  </P>

  Example:

  <PRE>
  MMapFile /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html
  </PRE>

  <P>
  <b>Note</b>: don't bother asking for a for a <code>MMapDir</code> directive which
  recursively maps all the files in a directory.  Use Unix the way it was
  meant to be used.  For example, see the
  <a href="core.html#include">Include</a> directive, and consider this command:
  <blockquote><pre>
  find /www/htdocs -type f -print | sed -e 's/.*/mmapfile &/' > /www/conf/mmap.conf
  </pre></blockquote>
