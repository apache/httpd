<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Known Bugs in Apache</H1>

The most up-to-date resource for bug tracking and information is the
<A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index">Apache bug database</A>.
Significant bugs at release time will also be noted there.
If you are running a 1.2 beta release or version 1.1.3 or earlier
and think you have found a bug, please upgrade to 1.2. Many bugs
in early versions have been fixed in 1.2.  It is also appreciated
if you could check the latest 1.3 beta releases, or at least review
the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/CHANGES">CHANGES</A> file
for it and ensure that your problem has not already been corrected.

<P>This document is not a complete list of known bugs, but simply
a list of some of the more common ones.  <FONT COLOR="red">Be sure
to check the bug database before assuming that if it isn't listed
here it isn't reported or fixed.</FONT>

<P>See Also: <A HREF="compat_notes.html">Compatibility notes</A>,

<H2>Apache 1.3b3 Bugs</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The error_log may contain "(0)Unknown error: mmap_handler:
    mmap failed" errors.  Ignore them, it is a logic error and does not
    indicate any problem.  This will be corrected in a later beta.
<LI>Servers operating in inetd mode will not properly implement timeouts.
    (Neither do servers operating with the -X command line switch for
    debugging.)
    This will be corrected in a later beta.  A workaround for now is
    to edit <CODE>src/main/httpd.h</CODE> and remove the definition
    of <CODE>OPTIMIZE_TIMEOUTS</CODE> near the bottom.
<LI><STRONG>Win32 only:</STRONG> Building from source may fail because the buildmark.obj
    file does not exist. Edit <CODE>Makefile.nt</CODE> and replace the
    line <CODE>del CoreR\buildmark.obj</CODE> with <CODE>-del
    CoreR\buildmark.obj</CODE> (and similarly for <CODE>del
    CoreD\buildmark.obj</CODE>). See 
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1473">PR#1473</A>.
<LI><STRONG>Solaris 2.6</STRONG> users may have troubles compiling the server with
    gcc.  As is frequently the case with gcc compilation troubles, this
    is the result of an improperly built gcc.  The gcc for solaris 2.6
    found at <A HREF="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">www.sunfreeware.com</A> 
    is now built with the release version of solaris 2.6.  The release version
    of solaris 2.6 changed a few header files enough that the beta-built
    gcc won't work with it.  There are two workarounds mentioned in
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1336">PR#1336</A>.
    <STRONG>This is not an Apache bug, and no code will be changed to deal with

<OL>
    <LI><A name="listenbug">On some architectures</A>
    if your configuration uses multiple
    <A HREF="../mod/core.html#listen">Listen</A> directives then it is possible
    that the server will starve one of the sockets while serving hits on
    another.  The work-around is to add
    <CODE>-DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</CODE> to the
    <CODE>EXTRA_CFLAGS</CODE> line in your Configuration and rebuild.
    (If you encounter problems with that, you can also try
    <CODE>-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</CODE>.)
    This affects any architecture that doesn't use one of the
    <CODE>USE_xxxxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</CODE> definitions, see the
    source file <CODE>conf.h</CODE> for your architecture.
    This is being tracked as
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/467">PR#467</A>.
    <P>To resolve this problem, we are adding one of the above settings
    to the default settings for platforms as we discover which is 
    appropriate for them.  <STRONG>New as of 1.3b3:</STRONG> the server will
    issue a warning when your architecture/config are subject to
    this bug.  The fixes and such are described in the PORTING
    file.  We are closing out this bug.
    </LI><P>

    <LI>
    The PATH_INFO part of a request URI cannot include the sequence
    <CODE>%2f</CODE>. This will be tracked as
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/543">PR#543</A>.
    </LI><P>

    <LI>Users of early 1.2 betas reported problems with many
    connections stuck in the FIN_WAIT_2 state due to server
    timeouts. Several changes were made during the beta testing of 1.2
    to reduce this problem as much as possible, although you may still
    see sockets in FIN_WAIT_2 state due to network or operating system
    issues outside the control of Apache. See our <A
    HREF="fin_wait_2.html">FIN_WAIT_2</A> page for more details.

    <P>SunOS4 has a kernel bug in the allocation of memory for the mbuf table.
    When it fills up, the result is a Panic the next time any routine tries
    to set something in an imaginary mbuf beyond the range of the table.
    Due to buggy browser behavior and the lack of a FIN_WAIT_2 timeout
    on SunOS4, "KeepAlive Off" is necessary to avoid filling up the mbuf
    table on busy sites.
    </LI><P>

    <LI>
    Compiling on Solaris 2 with SunSoft's C compiler gives the warning
    <CODE>"mod_include.c", line 1123: warning: end-of-loop code not
    reached</CODE>. This is a bogus warning and can be ignored.
    See <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/681">PR#681</A>.
    </LI><P>

    <LI>If compilation fails complaining about "unknown symbol __inet_ntoa()"
    then you have probably installed version 8 of bind. You will need to
    explicitly link with the bind library by adding <CODE>-lbind</CODE>
    to <CODE>EXTRA_LDFLAGS</CODE> in <CODE>Configuration</CODE>. See
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/616">PR#616</A>

    <LI>(Exists in 1.2.0 and in 1.2.1 after either of the
    <CODE>NO_SLACK</CODE> or patch provided by the previous bug are applied.)
    Solaris 2.5.1 (and probably other versions of Solaris) appear to have
    a race condition completely unrelated to all the others.  It is possible
    during a SIGHUP that the server will fail to start because it will not
    be able to re-open its sockets.  To our knowledge this has only shown
    up during testing when we pummel the server with as many SIGHUP requests
    per second as we can.  This appears unrelated to the similar sounding bug
    described in <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/832">PR#832</A>.

    Solaris 2 has problems with large numbers of virtual hosts. This is
