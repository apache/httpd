    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="proxy" name="proxy"><strong>Does or will Apache act
        as a Proxy server?</strong></a> 

        <p>Apache version 1.1 and above comes with a <a
        href="../mod/mod_proxy.html">proxy module</a>. If compiled
        in, this will make Apache act as a caching-proxy
        server.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="multiviews" name="multiviews"><strong>What are
        "multiviews"?</strong></a> 

        <p>"Multiviews" is the general name given to the Apache
        server's ability to provide language-specific document
        variants in response to a request. This is documented quite
        thoroughly in the <a href="../content-negotiation.html"
        rel="Help">content negotiation</a> description page. In
        addition, <cite>Apache Week</cite> carried an article on
        this subject entitled "<a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/negotiation"
        rel="Help"><cite>Content Negotiation
        Explained</cite></a>".</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="putsupport" name="putsupport"><strong>Why can't I
        publish to my Apache server using PUT on Netscape Gold and
        other programs?</strong></a> 

        <p>Because you need to install and configure a script to
        handle the uploaded files. This script is often called a
        "PUT" handler. There are several available, but they may
        have security problems. Using FTP uploads may be easier and
        more secure, at least for now. For more information, see
        the <cite>Apache Week</cite> article <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put"><cite>Publishing
        Pages with PUT</cite></a>.</p>
        <hr />

      <li>
        <a id="SSL-i" name="SSL-i"><strong>Why doesn't Apache
        include SSL?</strong></a> 

        <p>SSL (Secure Socket Layer) data transport requires
        encryption, and many governments have restrictions upon the
        import, export, and use of encryption technology. If Apache
        included SSL in the base package, its distribution would
        involve all sorts of legal and bureaucratic issues, and it
        would no longer be freely available. Also, some of the
        technology required to talk to current clients using SSL is
        patented by <a href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data
        Security</a>, who restricts its use without a license.</p>

        <p>Some SSL implementations of Apache are available,
        however; see the "<a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/related_projects.html">related
        projects</a>" page at the main Apache web site.</p>

        <p>You can find out more about this topic in the
        <cite>Apache Week</cite> article about <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/ssl"
        rel="Help"><cite>Apache and Secure
        Transactions</cite></a>.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="footer" name="footer"><strong>How can I attach a
        footer to my documents without using SSI?</strong></a> 

        <p>You can make arbitrary changes to static documents by
        configuring an <a
        href="../mod/mod_actions.html#action">Action</a> which
        launches a CGI script. The CGI is then responsible for
        setting a content-type and delivering the requested
        document (the location of which is passed in the
        <samp>PATH_TRANSLATED</samp> environment variable), along
        with whatever footer is needed.</p>

        <p>Busy sites may not want to run a CGI script on every
        request, and should consider using an Apache module to add
        the footer. There are several third party modules available
        through the <a href="http://modules.apache.org/">Apache
        Module Registry</a> which will add footers to documents.
        These include mod_trailer, PHP
        (<samp>php3_auto_append_file</samp>), mod_layout, and
        mod_perl (<samp>Apache::Sandwich</samp>).</p>

      <li>
        <a id="search" name="search"><strong>Does Apache include a
        search engine?</strong></a> 

        <p>Apache does not include a search engine, but there are
        many good commercial and free search engines which can be
        used easily with Apache. Some of them are listed on the <a
        href="http://www.searchtools.com/tools/tools.html">Web Site
        Search Tools</a> page. Open source search engines that are
        often used with Apache include <a
        href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</a> and <a
        href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/">SWISH-E</a>.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="rotate" name="rotate"><strong>How can I rotate my
        log files?</strong></a> 

        <p>The simple answer: by piping the transfer log into an
        appropriate log file rotation utility.</p>

        <p>The longer answer: In the src/support/ directory, you
        will find a utility called <a
        href="../programs/rotatelogs.html">rotatelogs</a> which can
        be used like this:</p>
<pre>
   TransferLog "|/path/to/rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
</pre>

        <p>to enable daily rotation of the log files.<br />
         A more sophisticated solution of a logfile rotation
        utility is available under the name <code>cronolog</code>
        from Andrew Ford's site at <a
        href="http://www.cronolog.org/">http://www.cronolog.org/</a>.
        It can automatically create logfile subdirectories based on
        time and date, and can have a constant symlink point to the
        rotating logfiles. (As of version 1.6.1, cronolog is
        available under the <a href="../LICENSE">Apache
        License</a>). Use it like this:</p>
<pre>
   CustomLog "|/path/to/cronolog --symlink=/usr/local/apache/logs/access_log /usr/local/apache/logs/%Y/%m/access_log" combined
</pre>

      <li>
        <a id="conditional-logging"
        name="conditional-logging"><strong>How do I keep certain
        requests from appearing in my logs?</strong></a> 

        <p>The maximum flexibility for removing unwanted
        information from log files is obtained by post-processing
        the logs, or using piped-logs to feed the logs through a
        program which does whatever you want. However, Apache does
        offer the ability to prevent requests from ever appearing
        in the log files. You can do this by using the <a
        href="../mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvif"><code>SetEnvIf</code></a>
        directive to set an environment variable for certain
        requests and then using the conditional <a
        href="../mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog-conditional"><code>
        CustomLog</code></a> syntax to prevent logging when the
        environment variable is set.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="dbinteg" name="dbinteg"><b>Does Apache support any
        sort of database integration?</b></a> 

        <p>No. Apache is a Web (HTTP) server, not an application
        server. The base package does not include any such
        functionality. See the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP
        project</a> and the <a
        href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl project</a> for
        examples of modules that allow you to work with databases
        from within the Apache environment.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="asp" name="asp"><b>Can I use Active Server Pages
        (ASP) with Apache?</b></a> 

        <p>The base Apache Web Server package does not include ASP
        support. However, a number of projects provide ASP or 
        ASP-like functionality for Apache. Some of these are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a
            href="http://www.apache-asp.org/">Apache::ASP</a></li>
            <li><a
            href="http://go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.10.html">mod_mono</a></li>

      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="java" name="java"><b>Does Apache come with Java
        support?</b></a> 

        <p>The base Apache Web server package does not include
        support for Java, Java Server Pages, Enterprise Java Beans,
        or Java servlets. Those features are available as add-ons
        from the Apache/Java project site, &lt;URL:<a
