#
# Yet another Apache Configure helper script.
# This script tests certain aspects of the compilation
# process. Right now, it can perform 5 tests:
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile lib <libname>
#    Which checks to see if <libname> exists on this system
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile lib <libname> <func>
#    Which checks to see if <libname> exists on this system and
#    contains func.
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile func <function>
#    Which checks to see if <function> exists
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile header <header>
#    Which checks to see if header file <header> exists
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile sanity
#    Which does a simple sanity check/test compile
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile sizeof <type>
#    Which prints out the sizeof <type> (sure would be nice
#    if sizeof could be use in preprocessor if's)
#
# ./helpers/TestCompile byteorder
#    Which prints out the byte order of the machine
#    (12: little endian, 21: big endian)
#
# It does these by creating a small mini-makefile, based on
# ../Makefile.config and trying to compile a small dummy
# program. If the compilation succeeds, we assume the test
# was successful as well.
#
# This must be run as './helpers/TestCompile' from
# the ./src directory (same directory that Configure is
# located) if you want to test it out. Configure must
# also call it as './helpers/TestCompile'
#
#
# INVOCATION SWITCHES:
# TestCompile evaluates the following switches
# (currently, it accepts only *ONE* of them!):
#
#  -v (enable verbose operation)
#   Enables VERBOSE=yes, see below.
#
#  -s (enforce silent operation)
#   Override a VERBOSE=yes, force it to VERBOSE=no.
#
#  -r (run generated test program)
#   Enables TCRUNIT=yes, see below
#
#  
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
# The following environment variables have influence on
# TestCompile's operation:
#
#  $VERBOSE (yes|no; default=no)
#    If set to "yes", will print compiler messages to stderr
#    Otherwise, stderr of all invoked programs is sent to /dev/null
#
#  $TCRUNIT (yes|no; default=no)
#    (This variable is obsoleted by the "-r" switch)
#    If set to "yes", will invoke the test program which was
#    generated by TestCompile. Useful for "TestCompile sizeof"
#    and "TestCompile byteorder" tests.
#    Otherwise, TestCompile only tests for the presence of a
#    generated program when deciding whether the compilation was
#    successful.
#
#  $TCADDINCL (#include <> stmt list; default=empty)
#    If set to an "#include <file>" preprocessor directive
#    (optionally several #include's separated by newlines), these
#    directives will be added to the generated test sources.
#    That allows, e.g., the "TestCompile sizeof" test to check for
#    types which are not defined in the standard locations.
#
#  $TLIB (additional libraries; default=empty)
#    If set to a list of additional libraries, these libs will be used
#    in addition to the one tested by the "TestCompile lib" call.
#    For the other TestCompile tests, it is ignored.
