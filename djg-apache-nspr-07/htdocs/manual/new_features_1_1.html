<H2>API Changes</H2>

A few changes to the Apache API were made for 1.1.  It is possible
that some third-party modules will no longer work with 1.1, though
we have made every effort to provide backwards-compatibility. If you
encounter a module that does not work with 1.1, please <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html">let us know</A>.


<H2>New Features with Apache 1.1</H2>
<P>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality (see also more detailed <CODE>CHANGES</CODE> file in
the source directory.)  Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the <A
HREF="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</A> if you have any
problems.</P>
<HR>

<P>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Apache
1.1</A> has the following specific new user features:</P>

<UL>

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="keepalive.html">Support for Keep-Alive Persistent
Connections</A></STRONG><BR> Apache now has (optional) support for persistent
connections, as defined by the HTTP/1.1 draft. This protocol,
supported by a number of current HTTP servers and browsers (including
Netscape Navigator 2.0) has been shown to increase speed of document
transfer by up to 50% in certain cases.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="vhosts/index.html">New non-IP Intensive VirtualHost
Support</A></STRONG><BR>
Apache's support for virtual hosts has been enhanced to be able to
use information sent by some new Web browsers to determine the server
being accessed, without requiring an additional IP address for each
host.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="bind.html">Listen to Multiple Addresses and
Ports</A></STRONG><BR>
Using the new <CODE>Listen</CODE> directive, Apache can listen to more
than one port and IP address, using the same configuration set.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_status.html">Status
Module</A></STRONG><BR>
Apache now contains a module that gives the web-master accurate,
up-to-date information about the server's status and its resource
consumption.  It also gives the current state of each server process
including the current URL being processed.  For an example, check out
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/status">the status of the
www.apache.org server</A>.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_info.html">Server Information Module</A></STRONG>
This module gives a plethora of information about the other modules
installed, their directives, and their configurations.  It is
extremely helpful in debugging configuration problems.  For an
example, check out <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/serv-info">information about the
www.apache.org server</A>.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html">Experimental Caching Proxy
Server</A></STRONG><BR>
Apache can now act as
an HTTP proxy server, allowing clients behind firewalls to use the
server to access the outside world. In addition, it can cache
documents it proxies, speeding up access to frequently requested
documents.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="location.html">URL-based Access Protection</A></STRONG>
<BR>
In addition to access checking and authorization by filename (with
<CODE><A HREF="mod/core.html#directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</A></CODE>),
the new <CODE>&lt;Location&gt;</CODE> directive allows protection by
URL.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_actions.html">Filetype-based Script
"Actions"</A></STRONG><BR>
You can now run CGI scripts whenever a file of a certain type is
requested. This makes it much easier to execute scripts that process
files. In addition, you can use the new <A
HREF="mod/mod_actions.html#script">Script</A> directive to enable scripts
for files called with HTTP methods Apache does not natively support.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="handler.html">New "Handler" Directives</A></STRONG><BR>
The new <CODE>AddHandler</CODE> and <CODE>SetHandler</CODE> directive
allows "handlers" to be defined for filename extensions or
directories. These handlers, which can either be built into Apache or
added with the <A HREF="mod/mod_actions.html">Action</A> directive, extend
Apache's range of usability, and almost entirely remove the "magic"
media types.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_env.html">Customizable CGI Environment
Variables</A></STRONG><BR>
New <CODE>PassEnv</CODE> and <CODE>SetEnv</CODE> directives allow you to
modify the environment variables passed to CGI scripts.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_cern_meta.html">CERN Metafile Support</A></STRONG>
<BR>
Now emulates the CERN httpd's support for metafiles containing additional
HTTP headers to be supplied with a document.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_imap.html">Improved Imagemap Support</A></STRONG>
<BR>
The internal imagemap handling code has been rewritten and
reorganized, adding new handling of default, base and relative URLs,
and support for creating non-graphical menus for use with clients that
do not support imagemaps.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_userdir.html">Improved UserDir
Directive</A></STRONG>
<BR>
Now supports the ability to point user's files (as specified by URLs
beginning with the "<CODE>~</CODE>" character) at directories other
than those specified by the Unix password file.

<LI><STRONG>Minimal DNS Now Runtime Option</STRONG><BR>
New <CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE>
server configuration directive can be used to turn <CODE>On</CODE> or
<CODE>Off</CODE> DNS lookups. This supersedes the -DMINIMAL_DNS
compile-time configuration option. This option can be set per-directory.

<LI><STRONG>IdentityCheck Now Per-Directory  Option</STRONG>
<BR>
The <CODE>IdentityCheck</CODE> directive, which controls the use of
ident to check the remote user name, can now be set per directory. The
ident support is also RFC 1413-compliant.

<LI><STRONG>Redirect Now Usable in <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> Files</STRONG>
<BR>
The <A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#redirect"><CODE>Redirect</CODE></A>
directive can now be used in <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files when the
<CODE>FileInfo</CODE> directive has been set on. This allows users to
redirect parts of their directories without requiring CGI scripts

<LI><STRONG>ErrorDocument Now Usable in <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> Files</STRONG>
<BR>
The <A HREF="custom-error.html"><CODE>ErrorDocument</CODE></A>
directive can now be used in <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files when the
<CODE>FileInfo</CODE> directive has been set on. This allows users to
have different error messages for different sections of a site.

<LI><STRONG><CODE>ForceType</CODE> Directive</STRONG>
<BR>
This new directive, in <CODE>&lt;Directory&gt;</CODE> sections or
.htaccess files, allows you to override the filename extensions and
force a single content type. (e.g. <CODE>ForceType
application/octet-stream</CODE>)

<LI><STRONG>File Owner Available to Included CGI Scripts</STRONG>
<BR>
Server-side includes that call CGI scripts will now set a
<CODE>USER_NAME</CODE> environment variable that contains the owner of
the file which included it.

<LI><STRONG>Improved Icons</STRONG>
<BR>
Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:kevinh@eit.com">Kevin
Hughes</A>, Apache's nifty color GIF icons for directory listings have
been updated. In addition, the <A
HREF="../apache_pb.gif">Powered by Apache</A>
(<CODE>apache_pb.gif</CODE>) logo has been included.

</UL>

<HR>

<H3>New Authentication Modules</H3>

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> These modules are not
compiled into the server by default, as they require special support
on the host system. They must be enabled specifically in the
<CODE>Configuration</CODE> file.</P>

<UL>

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_auth_anon.html">Anonymous HTTP Logins</A></STRONG>
<BR>
New options allow you to allow, using Basic HTTP Authentication,
anonymous logins, like those of FTP. This allows you to collect email
addresses of people accessing your site.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_digest.html">Support for Digest
Authentication</A></STRONG><BR>
Apache now supports digest authentication using RSA MD5
encryption. When used with a supporting web browser, this provides a
more secure alternative to Basic authentication.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_auth_db.html">Support for Unix DB
Authentication</A></STRONG> - <CODE>mod_auth_db.c</CODE><BR> In
addition to <A HREF="mod/mod_auth_dbm.html">DBM</A> support, Apache now
contains optional support for Berkeley DB databases.

<LI><STRONG>mSQL Database
Authentication</STRONG> - <CODE>mod_auth_msql.html</CODE> <BR>
Support for the use of mSQL databases for user authentication via HTTP
is now supported.

</UL>

<HR>

<H3>OS/2 Support</H3>

<P>Apache now includes support for OS/2, thanks to
<A HREF="http://www.slink.com/ApacheOS2/">Softlink Services</A>.</P>
