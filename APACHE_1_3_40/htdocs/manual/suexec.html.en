    <h3><a id="what" name="what">What is suEXEC?</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">The <strong>suEXEC</strong> feature --
    introduced in Apache 1.2 -- provides Apache users the ability
    to run <strong>CGI</strong> and <strong>SSI</strong> programs
    under user IDs different from the user ID of the calling
    web-server. Normally, when a CGI or SSI program executes, it
    runs as the same user who is running the web server.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Used properly, this feature can reduce
    considerably the security risks involved with allowing users to
    develop and run private CGI or SSI programs. However, if suEXEC
    is improperly configured, it can cause any number of problems
    and possibly create new holes in your computer's security. If
    you aren't familiar with managing setuid root programs and the
    security issues they present, we highly recommend that you not
    consider using suEXEC.</p>

    <p align="CENTER"><strong><a href="suexec.html">BACK TO
    CONTENTS</a></strong></p>

    <h3><a id="before" name="before">Before we begin.</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">Before jumping head-first into this document,
    you should be aware of the assumptions made on the part of the
    Apache Group and this document.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">First, it is assumed that you are using a UNIX
    derivate operating system that is capable of
    <strong>setuid</strong> and <strong>setgid</strong> operations.
    All command examples are given in this regard. Other platforms,
    if they are capable of supporting suEXEC, may differ in their
    configuration.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Second, it is assumed you are familiar with
    some basic concepts of your computer's security and its
    administration. This involves an understanding of
    <strong>setuid/setgid</strong> operations and the various
    effects they may have on your system and its level of
    security.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Third, it is assumed that you are using an
    <strong>unmodified</strong> version of suEXEC code. All code
    for suEXEC has been carefully scrutinized and tested by the
    developers as well as numerous beta testers. Every precaution
    has been taken to ensure a simple yet solidly safe base of
    code. Altering this code can cause unexpected problems and new
    security risks. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that
    you do not alter the suEXEC code unless you are well versed in 
    the particulars of security programming and are willing to share
    your work with the Apache Group for consideration.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Fourth, and last, it has been the decision of
    the Apache Group to <strong>NOT</strong> make suEXEC part of
    the default installation of Apache. To this end, suEXEC
    configuration requires careful attention to details from the
    administrator. After due consideration has been given to the
    various settings for suEXEC, the administrator may install
    suEXEC through normal installation methods. The values for
    these settings need to be carefully determined and specified by
    the administrator to properly maintain system security during
    the use of suEXEC functionality. It is through this detailed
    process that the Apache Group hopes to limit suEXEC
    installation only to those who are careful and determined
    enough to use it.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Still with us? Yes? Good. Let's move on!</p>

    <p align="CENTER"><strong><a href="suexec.html">BACK TO
    CONTENTS</a></strong></p>

    <h3><a id="model" name="model">suEXEC Security Model</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">Before we begin configuring and installing
    suEXEC, we will first discuss the security model you are about
    to implement. By doing so, you may better understand what
    exactly is going on inside suEXEC and what precautions are
    taken to ensure your system's security.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>suEXEC</strong> is based on a setuid
    "wrapper" program that is called by the main Apache web server.
    This wrapper is called when an HTTP request is made for a CGI
    or SSI program that the administrator has designated to run as
    a userid other than that of the main server. When such a
    request is made, Apache provides the suEXEC wrapper with the
    program's name and the user and group IDs under which the
    program is to execute.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The wrapper then employs the following process
    to determine success or failure -- if any one of these
    conditions fail, the program logs the failure and exits with an
    error, otherwise it will continue:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Was the wrapper called with the proper number of
        arguments?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          The wrapper will only execute if it is given the proper
          number of arguments. The proper argument format is known
          to the Apache web server. If the wrapper is not receiving
          the proper number of arguments, it is either being
          hacked, or there is something wrong with the suEXEC
          portion of your Apache binary.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the user executing this wrapper a valid user of
        this system?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          This is to ensure that the user executing the wrapper is
          truly a user of the system.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is this valid user allowed to run the
        wrapper?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Is this user the user allowed to run this wrapper? Only
          one user (the Apache user) is allowed to execute this
          program.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Does the target program have an unsafe hierarchical
        reference?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Does the target program contain a leading '/' or have a
          '..' backreference? These are not allowed; the target
          program must reside within the Apache webspace.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target user name valid?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Does the target user exist?
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target group name valid?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Does the target group exist?
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target user <em>NOT</em> superuser?</strong>
        

        <blockquote>
          Presently, suEXEC does not allow 'root' to execute
          CGI/SSI programs.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target userid <em>ABOVE</em> the minimum ID
        number?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          The minimum user ID number is specified during
          configuration. This allows you to set the lowest possible
          userid that will be allowed to execute CGI/SSI programs.
          This is useful to block out "system" accounts.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target group <em>NOT</em> the superuser
        group?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Presently, suEXEC does not allow the 'root' group to
          execute CGI/SSI programs.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target groupid <em>ABOVE</em> the minimum ID
        number?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          The minimum group ID number is specified during
          configuration. This allows you to set the lowest possible
          groupid that will be allowed to execute CGI/SSI programs.
          This is useful to block out "system" groups.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Can the wrapper successfully become the target user
        and group?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Here is where the program becomes the target user and
          group via setuid and setgid calls. The group access list
          is also initialized with all of the groups of which the
          user is a member.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Does the directory in which the program resides
        exist?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          If it doesn't exist, it can't very well contain files.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the directory within the Apache
        webspace?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          If the request is for a regular portion of the server, is
          the requested directory within the server's document
          root? If the request is for a UserDir, is the requested
          directory within the user's document root?
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the directory <em>NOT</em> writable by anyone
        else?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          We don't want to open up the directory to others; only
          the owner user may be able to alter this directories
          contents.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Does the target program exist?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          If it doesn't exists, it can't very well be executed.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target program <em>NOT</em> writable by
        anyone else?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          We don't want to give anyone other than the owner the
          ability to change the program.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target program <em>NOT</em> setuid or
        setgid?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          We do not want to execute programs that will then change
          our UID/GID again.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Is the target user/group the same as the program's
        user/group?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Is the user the owner of the file?
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Can we successfully clean the process environment
        to ensure safe operations?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          suEXEC cleans the process' environment by establishing a
          safe execution PATH (defined during configuration), as
          well as only passing through those variables whose names
          are listed in the safe environment list (also created
          during configuration).
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Can we successfully become the target program and
        execute?</strong> 

        <blockquote>
          Here is where suEXEC ends and the target program begins.
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p align="LEFT">This is the standard operation of the
    suEXEC wrapper's security model. It is somewhat stringent and
    can impose new limitations and guidelines for CGI/SSI design,
    but it was developed carefully step-by-step with security in
    mind.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">For more information as to how this security
    model can limit your possibilities in regards to server
    configuration, as well as what security risks can be avoided

    <h3><a id="install" name="install">Configuring &amp; Installing
    suEXEC</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">Here's where we begin the fun. If you use
    Apache 1.2 or prefer to configure Apache 1.3 with the
    "<code>src/Configure</code>" script you have to edit the suEXEC
    header file and install the binary in its proper location
    manually. This procedure is described in an <a
    href="suexec_1_2.html">extra document</a>. The following
    sections describe the configuration and installation for Apache
    1.3 with the AutoConf-style interface (APACI).</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>APACI's suEXEC configuration
    options</strong><br />
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>--enable-suexec</code></dt>

      <dd>This option enables the suEXEC feature which is never
      installed or activated by default. At least one
      --suexec-xxxxx option has to be provided together with the
      --enable-suexec option to let APACI accept your request for
      using the suEXEC feature.</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-caller=<em>UID</em></code></dt>

      <dd>The <a href="mod/core.html#user">username</a> under which
      Apache normally runs. This is the only user allowed to
      execute this program.</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-docroot=<em>DIR</em></code></dt>

      <dd>Define as the DocumentRoot set for Apache. This will be
      the only hierarchy (aside from UserDirs) that can be used for
      suEXEC behavior. The default directory is the --datadir value
      with the suffix "/htdocs", <em>e.g.</em> if you configure
      with "<code>--datadir=/home/apache</code>" the directory
      "/home/apache/htdocs" is used as document root for the suEXEC
      wrapper.</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-logfile=<em>FILE</em></code></dt>

      <dd>This defines the filename to which all suEXEC
      transactions and errors are logged (useful for auditing and
      debugging purposes). By default the logfile is named
      "suexec_log" and located in your standard logfile directory
      (--logfiledir).</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-userdir=<em>DIR</em></code></dt>

      <dd>Define to be the subdirectory under users' home
      directories where suEXEC access should be allowed. All
      executables under this directory will be executable by suEXEC
      as the user so they should be "safe" programs. If you are
      using a "simple" UserDir directive (ie. one without a "*" in
      it) this should be set to the same value. suEXEC will not
      work properly in cases where the UserDir directive points to
      a location that is not the same as the user's home directory
      as referenced in the passwd file. Default value is
      "public_html".<br />
       If you have virtual hosts with a different UserDir for each,
      you will need to define them to all reside in one parent
      directory; then name that parent directory here. <strong>If
      this is not defined properly, "~userdir" cgi requests will
      not work!</strong></dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-uidmin=<em>UID</em></code></dt>

      <dd>Define this as the lowest UID allowed to be a target user
      for suEXEC. For most systems, 500 or 100 is common. Default
      value is 100.</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-gidmin=<em>GID</em></code></dt>

      <dd>Define this as the lowest GID allowed to be a target
      group for suEXEC. For most systems, 100 is common and
      therefore used as default value.</dd>

      <dt><code>--suexec-safepath=<em>PATH</em></code></dt>

      <dd>Define a safe PATH environment to pass to CGI
      executables. Default value is
      "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin".</dd>
    </dl>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>Checking your suEXEC
    setup</strong><br />
     Before you compile and install the suEXEC wrapper you can
    check the configuration with the --layout option.<br />
     Example output:</p>
<pre>
    suEXEC setup:
            suexec binary: /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec
            document root: /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs
           userdir suffix: public_html
                  logfile: /usr/local/apache/var/log/suexec_log
                safe path: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
                caller ID: www
          minimum user ID: 100
         minimum group ID: 100
</pre>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>Compiling and installing the suEXEC
    wrapper</strong><br />
     If you have enabled the suEXEC feature with the
    --enable-suexec option the suexec binary (together with Apache
    itself) is automatically built if you execute the command
    "make".<br />
     After all components have been built you can execute the
    command "make install" to install them. The binary image
    "suexec" is installed in the directory defined by the --sbindir
    option. Default location is
    "/usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec".<br />
     Please note that you need <strong><em>root
    privileges</em></strong> for the installation step. In order
    for the wrapper to set the user ID, it must be installed as
    owner <code><em>root</em></code> and must have the setuserid
    execution bit set for file modes.</p>

    <h3><a id="enable" name="enable">Enabling &amp; Disabling
    suEXEC</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">Upon startup of Apache, it looks for the file
    "suexec" in the "sbin" directory (default is
    "/usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec"). If Apache finds a properly
    configured suEXEC wrapper, it will print the following message
    to the error log:</p>
<pre>
    [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: <em>/path/to/suexec</em>)
</pre>

    <p>If you don't see this message at server startup, the server
    is most likely not finding the wrapper program where it expects
    it, or the executable is not installed <em>setuid
    root</em>.<br />
     If you want to enable the suEXEC mechanism for the first time
    and an Apache server is already running you must kill and
    restart Apache. Restarting it with a simple HUP or USR1 signal
    will not be enough.<br />
     If you want to disable suEXEC you should kill and restart
    Apache after you have removed the "suexec" file.</p>

    <h3><a id="usage" name="usage">Using suEXEC</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>Virtual Hosts:</strong><br />
     One way to use the suEXEC wrapper is through the <a
    href="mod/core.html#user">User</a> and <a
    href="mod/core.html#group">Group</a> directives in <a
    href="mod/core.html#virtualhost">VirtualHost</a> definitions.
    By setting these directives to values different from the main
    server user ID, all requests for CGI resources will be executed
    as the <em>User</em> and <em>Group</em> defined for that
    <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>. If only one or neither of
    these directives are specified for a
    <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> then the main server userid is
    assumed.</p>

    <p><strong>User directories:</strong><br />
     The suEXEC wrapper can also be used to execute CGI programs as
    the user to which the request is being directed. This is
    accomplished by using the "<strong><code>~</code></strong>"
    character prefixing the user ID for whom execution is desired.
    The only requirement needed for this feature to work is for CGI
    execution to be enabled for the user and that the script must
    meet the scrutiny of the <a href="#model">security checks</a>
    above.</p>

      <li><strong>suEXEC Points Of Interest</strong></li>

      <li>
        Hierarchy limitations 

        <blockquote>
          For security and efficiency reasons, all suexec requests
          must remain within either a top-level document root for
          virtual host requests, or one top-level personal document
          root for userdir requests. For example, if you have four
          VirtualHosts configured, you would need to structure all
          of your VHosts' document roots off of one main Apache
          document hierarchy to take advantage of suEXEC for
          VirtualHosts. (Example forthcoming.)
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        suEXEC's PATH environment variable 

        <blockquote>
          This can be a dangerous thing to change. Make certain
          every path you include in this define is a
          <strong>trusted</strong> directory. You don't want to
          open people up to having someone from across the world
          running a trojan horse on them.
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        Altering the suEXEC code 

        <blockquote>
          Again, this can cause <strong>Big Trouble</strong> if you
          try this without knowing what you are doing. Stay away
          from it if at all possible.
