Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) mod_unique_id: Use output of the PRNG rather than IP address and
     pid, avoiding sleep() call and possible DNS issues at startup,
     plus improving randomness for IPv6-only hosts.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) core: Log a message at TRACE1 when the client aborts a connection.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) core: Replace pre_htaccess hook with more flexible open_htaccess hook.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Support primitive LDAP servers that do not accept
     filters, such as "SDBM-backed LDAP" on z/OS, by allowing a special
     filter "none" to be specified in AuthLDAPURL. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_file_cache: mod_file_cache should be able to serve files that
     haven't had a Content-Type set via e.g. mod_mime. [Eric Covener]

  *) core: merge AllowEncodedSlashes from the base configuration into
     virtual hosts. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_headers: Add 'setifempty' command to Header and RequestHeader.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) AIX: Install DSO's with "cp" instead of "install" in instdso.sh
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ldap: Retry transient LDAP connection errors when they occur 
     during the authorization stage. 
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ldap: Don't keep retrying if a new LDAP connection times out.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_deflate: permit compilation of mod_deflate against a zlib that has
     been configured with -D Z_PREFIX, which redefines the token "deflate".
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_socache_shmcb.c: Remove arbitrary restriction on shared memory size
     previously limited to 64MB. [Jens Låås <jelaas gmail.com>]

  *) mod_auth_digest: Use the secret when generating nonces in all cases and
     not only when AuthName is used in .htaccess files (this change may cause
     problems if used with round robin load balancers). Don't regenerate the
     secret on graceful restarts. PR 54637  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) ab: Add a new -l parameter in order not to check the length of the responses.
     This can be usefull with dynamic pages.
     PR9945, PR27888, PR42040 [<ccikrs1 cranbrook edu>]
     
  *) mod_logio: new format-specifier %C (combined) which is the sum of received
     and sent byte counts.
     PR54015 [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) core: Remove apr_brigade_flatten(), buffering and duplicated code
     from the HTTP_IN filter, parse chunks in a single pass with zero copy.
     Reduce memory usage by 48 bytes per request. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Stop the HTTP_IN filter from attempting to write error buckets
     to the output filters, which is bogus in the proxy case. Create a
     clean mapping from APR codes to HTTP status codes, and use it where
     needed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be
     compliant with RFC2616 14.9.4 Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls.

  *) mod_dav: mod_dav overrides dav_fs response on PUT failure. PR 35981
     [Basant Kumar Kukreja <basant.kukreja sun.com>, Alejandro Alvarez
     <alejandro.alvarez.ayllon cern.ch>]

  *) core, mod_ssl: Lift the restriction that prevents mod_ssl taking
     full advantage of the event MPM. Enable the ability for a module
     to reverse the sense of a poll event from a read to a write or vice
     versa. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ldap: LDAP connections used for authentication were not respecting
     LDAPConnectionPoolTimeout.  PR 54587

  *) core: ap_rgetline_core now pulls from r->proto_input_filters.

  *) mod_proxy_html: process parsed comments immediately. 
     Fixes bug where parsed comments may be lost. [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: introduce doctype for HTML 5 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix typo-bug processing "strict" vs "transitional"
     HTML/XHTML [Nick Kew]

  *) core: Add option to add valgrind support. Use it to reduce false positive
     warnings in mod_ssl. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) http: Remove support for Request-Range header sent by Navigator 2-3 and
     MSIE 3. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core, http: Extend HttpProtocol with an option to enforce stricter HTTP
     conformance or to only log the found problems. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Correctly parse an IPv6 literal host specification in an absolute
     URL in the request line. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for OpenSSL configuration commands [Stephen Henson]

  *) EventOpt MPM

  *) core: Add LogLevelOverride directive that allows to override the
     loglevel for clients from certain IPs. This also works for things
     like the SSL handshake where <If> LogLevel ... </If> is evaluated
     too late. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Add new directive Warning to issue warnings from a configuration
     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.
     [Fabien Coelho] 

  *) ap_expr: Add SERVER_PROTOCOL_VERSION, ..._MAJOR, and ..._MINOR
     variables. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard
     HTTP methods. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive HttpProtocol which allows to disable HTTP/0.9
     support. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_allowhandlers: New module to forbid specific handlers for specific
     directories. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_systemd: New module, for integration with systemd on Linux.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) core: Add pre_htaccess hook, allowing mpm-itk
     to be used without patches to httpd core.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) WinNT MPM: Store pid and generation for each thread in scoreboard
     to allow tracking of threads from exiting children via mod_status
     or other such mechanisms.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ssl: Catch missing or mismatched client cert/key pairs with
     SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile/Path directives.  PR 52212.  
     [Keith Burdis <keith burdis.org>, Joe Orton]

  *) The following now respect DefaultRuntimeDir/DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR:
     - APIs: ap_log_pid(), ap_remove_pid, ap_read_pid()
     - core: the scoreboard (ScoreBoardFile), pid file (PidFile), and
       mutexes (Mutex)
     - mod_cache: thundering herd lock directory
     - mod_lbmethod_heartbeat, mod_heartmonitor: heartbeat storage file
     - mod_ldap: shared memory cache
     - mod_socache_shmcb, mod_socache_dbm: shared memory or dbm for cache
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) suexec: Add --enable-suexec-capabilites support on Linux, to use
     setuid/setgid capability bits rather than a setuid root binary.
     [Joe Orton]

  *) suexec: Add support for logging to syslog as an alternative to logging
     to a file; configure --without-suexec-logfile --with-suexec-syslog.  
     [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for TLS Next Protocol Negotiation.  PR 52210.
     [Matthew Steele <mdsteele google.com>]

  *) cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will
     be compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
     Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
     PR 51257. [Guenter Knauf]

  *) core: In maintainer mode, replace apr_palloc with a version that
     initializes the allocated memory with non-zero values, except if
     AP_DEBUG_NO_ALLOC_POISON is defined. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_policy: Add a new testing module to help server administrators
     enforce a configurable level of protocol compliance on their
     servers and application servers behind theirs. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_firehose: Add a new debugging module able to record traffic
     passing through the server in such a way that connections and/or
     requests be reconstructed and replayed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_noloris

  *) APREQ

  *) Simple MPM

  *) mod_serf
