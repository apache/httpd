Changes with Apache 2.5.0-alpha

  *) mpm_event: avoid a very unlikely race condition between the listener and
     the workers when the latter fails to add a connection to the pollset.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_macro: fix usability of globally defined macros in .htaccess files.
     PR 57525.  [Jose Kahan <jose w3.org>, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.1, ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer
     auto-added to a Managed Domain. Error counts of jobs are presisted. When the server
     restarts (gracefully) any errored staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal
     process. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) htpasswd: Don't fail in -v mode if password file is unwritable.
     PR 61631.  [Joe Orton]

  *) core: A signal received while stopping could have crashed the main

  *) mod_md: v1.0.0, new config directive 'MDNotifyCmd' to hook in a program when Managed
     Domains have obtained/renewed their certificates successfully. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite, core: add the Vary header when a condition evaluates to true
     and the related RewriteRule is used in a Directory context
     (triggering an internal redirect). [Luca Toscano]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.9, fix for applying challenge type based on available ports. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: New UWSGI mod_proxy (sub)module contributed by unbit.com.

  *) mod_http2: v0.10.12, removed optimization for mutex handling in bucket beams that 
    could lead to assertion failure in edge cases. [Stefan Eissing] 
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.7
     - Use of the new module flag
     - Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. 
     - Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
     - MDRequireHttps now happens before any Redirect.

  *) mod_authz_dbd: fix a segmentation fault if AuthzDBDQuery is not set.
     PR 61546 [Lubos Uhliarik <luhliari redhat.com>]

  *) mod_ssl: unshare SSLSrvConfigRec instances between base server and virtual hosts. This avoids
     overwrites of later initializattions (vhost_id), selective disables by "SSLEngine addr-list"
     and certificate/key pickup from mod_md. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite, core: Avoid the 'Vary: Host' response header when HTTP_HOST is
     used in a condition that evaluates to true. PR 58231 [Luca Toscano, Yann Ylavic]

     HSTS (rfc 6797) headers in https: responses. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: adding ssl_policies.h[.in] for policy cipher/protocol definitions. Use 
     update_policies.py to update manually from Mozilla JSON definitions at
     https://statics.tls.security.mozilla.org/server-side-tls-conf.json
     [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.5:
     - New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
       new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
     - Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
       after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
       to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messsages might appear a
       second time in the logs.
     - Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
       is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
       VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
       its address list.
     - New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
       or temporarily.
     - Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
       a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.
     - compatibility with libressl
       [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.2: new directive 'MDHttpProxy' to define a proxy for outgoing connection,
     some minor bugfixes, twiddle the build system to avoid non-pic code generation.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_ssl: Adding option to set a list of addr:port specs, as used in VirtualHosts
     to enable SSLEngine for all matching hosts. Updated documentation. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.1:
     - various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
       someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
       reload and change back to the wanted ones.
     - various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
     - mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
       to facilitate upgrades.
    [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.0:
     Certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs) for mod_ssl virtual hosts.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: add SSLPolicy (define/use) and SSLProxyPolicy directives plus documentation. Add
     core definitions for policies 'modern', 'intermediate' and 'old', as defined by Mozilla
     in <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: new module for managing domains across VirtualHosts with ACME protocol 
     implementation for automated certificate signup and renewal. Default CA is
     the test area of Let's Encrypt right now, so certificates root will not be valid.
     Will be switched to the real service endpoint rather soon. If you need it now,
     configure 'MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Add the support for mod_proxy's flushpackets and flushwait
     parameters. [Luca Toscano, Ruediger Pluem, Yann Ylavic]

     and <IfModule> to be quoted.  This is primarily for the benefit of
     <IfFile>. [Eric Covener]

  *) Introduce request taint checking framework to prevent privilege
     hijacking through .htaccess. [Nick Kew]

  *) Add <IfDirective> and <IfSection> directives.  [Joe Orton]

  *) When using mod_status with the Event MPM, report the number of requests
     associated with an active connection in the "ACC" field. Previously
     zero was always reported with this MPM.  PR60647. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_remoteip: Add support for PROXY protocol (code donated by Cloudzilla).
     Add ability for PROXY protocol processing to be optional to donated code.

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Drop an invalid Last-Modified header value coming
     from a FCGI/CGI script instead of replacing it with Unix epoch.
     Warn the users about Last-Modified header value replacements
     and violations of the RFC.
     [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano, William Rowe, Jacob Champion]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]
