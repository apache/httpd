Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) core: Limit accepted chunk-size to 2^63-1 and be strict about chunk-ext
     authorized characters.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: When SSLVerify is disabled (NONE), don't force a renegotiation if
     the SSLVerifyDepth applied with the default/handshaken vhost differs from
     the one applicable with the finally selected vhost.  [Yann Ylavic]
     
  *) core: Avoid a possible truncation of the faulty header included in the
     HTML response when LimitRequestFieldSize is reached.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: add ALPN support by allowing other modules to register callbacks
     for negotiation of the application layer protocol.  PR 52210.
     [Matthew Steele <mdsteele google com>, Joe Orton, Jim Jagielski,
      Stefan Eissing <stefan eissing org>, Rainer Jung, Ruediger Pluem,
      Kaspar Brand]

  *) http: Don't remove the Content-Length of zero from a HEAD response if
     it comes from an origin server, module or script.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core/util_script: make REDIRECT_URL a full URL.  PR 57785. [Nick Kew]

  *) http: Add support for RFC2324/RFC7168. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix a race condition that caused a failed worker to be retried

  *) mod_authn_core: Add expression support to AuthName and AuthType.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Define and UnDefine are no longer permitted in
     directory context. Previously they would always be evaulated
     as the configuration was read without regard for the directory
     context. [Eric Covener]

     that none are specified in the configuration file. 
     [Joachim Zobel <jzobel heute-morgen.de>, Eric Covener]

     how the input was tokenized.  PR 56528. [Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy: Don't put non balancer-member workers in error state by
     default for connection or 500/503 errors, and honor status=+I for
     any error.  PR 48388.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_socache_memcache: Pass expiration time through to memcached. PR 55445.
     [Faidon Liambotis <paravoid debian.org>, Joe Orton]

  *) ap_expr: Add filemod function for checking file modification dates
     [Daniel Gruno]
     
  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Resolve crashes with LDAP authz and non-LDAP authn since 
     r1608202. [Eric Covener]
 
  *) core: Ensure that httpd exits with an error status when the MPM fails
     to run.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) apreq: Content-Length header should be always interpreted as a decimal.
     Leading 0 could be erroneously considered as an octal value. PR 56598.
     [Chris Card <ctcard hotmail com>]
  
  *) mod_proxy: Now allow for 191 character worker names, with non-fatal
     errors if name is truncated. PR53218. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_ssl: Add optional function "ssl_get_tls_cb" to allow support
     for channel bindings.  [Simo Sorce <simo redhat.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Concurrent websockets messages could be 
     lost or delayed with ProxyWebsocketAsync enabled.

     number display.  [Rainer Jung]

     the service control interface for Windows.  [William Rowe]
  
  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Return LDAP connections to the pool before the handler
     is run, instead of waiting until the end of the request. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_log_config: Add GlobalLog to allow a globally defined log to
     be inherited by virtual hosts that define a CustomLog.
     [Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]

  *) MPMs: Support SO_REUSEPORT to create multiple duplicated listener
     records for scalability. [Yingqi Lu <yingqi.lu@intel.com>,
     Jeff Trawick, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy_html: support automatic detection of doctype and processing
     of FPIs.  PR56285 [Micha Lenk <micha lenk info>, Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: skip documents shorter than 4 bytes
     PR 56286 [Micha Lenk <micha lenk info>]

  *) mod_proxy_fdpass: Fix computation of the size of 'struct sockaddr_un'
     when passed to 'connect()'.

     to resume. PR56333

     unnecessary apr_pstrdup() and strlen(). [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_remoteip: Prevent an external proxy from presenting an internal
     proxy. PR 55962. [Mike Rumph]

  *) mod_ssl: Add hooks to allow other modules to perform processing at
     several stages of initialization and connection handling.  See
     mod_ssl_openssl.h.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Avoid sending error responses down an upgraded
     websockets connection as it is being close down. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Support an optional list of characters to escape in the 
     argument for the 'B' (escape backreferences) flag. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_dir: Default to 2.2-like behavior and skip execution when method is
     neither GET nor POST, such as for DAV requests. PR 54914. [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_rewrite: Rename the handler that does per-directory internal 
     redirects to "rewrite-redirect-handler" from "redirect-handler" so
     it is less ambiguous and less likely to be reused. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Protect against looping with the [N] flag by enforcing a 
     default limit of 10000 iterations, and allowing each rule to change its
     limit. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix config merging of SSLOCSPEnable and SSLOCSPOverrideResponder.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add HttpContentLengthHeadZero and HttpExpectStrict directives.
     [Yehuda Sadeh <yehuda inktank com>, Justin Erenkrantz]

     Previously, this code was part of core, now it's in separate module.
     [Jan Kaluza]

  *) core: Add ap_errorlog_provider to make ErrorLog logging modular. Move
     syslog support from core to new mod_syslog. [Jan Kaluza]

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.

  *) core: Add new directive Warning to issue warnings from a configuration
     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.

     variables. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard

     to allow tracking of threads from exiting children via mod_status
     or other such mechanisms.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The following now respect DefaultRuntimeDir/DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR:
     - APIs: ap_log_pid(), ap_remove_pid, ap_read_pid()
     - core: the scoreboard (ScoreBoardFile), pid file (PidFile), and
       mutexes (Mutex)
     - mod_cache: thundering herd lock directory
