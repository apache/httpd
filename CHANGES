     specific ap_cache_cacheable_headers_in()/out(). The latter

     Introduces a level of privacy when sessions are stored on the

     session information within cookies on the browser. Useful for high
     volume sites where server bound sessions are too resource intensive.

  *) mod_session: Add a generic session interface to unify the different
     attempts at saving persistent sessions across requests.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
     with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
     original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests

     providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authn_core that will provide common
     authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'.  Move the directives
     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias 
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy' 
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide 
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as 
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>' 
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR' 
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the 
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz 
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and 
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked 
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to 
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
     [Martin Kraemer, David Reid]
