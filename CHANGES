     terminated by the ldap server.  PR 40878.
     [Rob Baily <rbaily servicebench com>]

  *) mod_mem_cache: Convert mod_mem_cache to use APR memory pool functions
     by creating a root pool for object persistence across requests. This
     also eliminates the need for custom serialization code.
     [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Add an AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute directive. If
     set, REMOTE_USER will be set to this attribute, rather than the
     username supplied by the user. Useful for example when you want users
     to log in using an email address, but need to supply a userid instead
     to the backend.  [Graham Leggett]

     of listen sockets in some configurations with multiple generic Listen
     directives.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_headers: Support regexp-based editing of HTTP headers.  [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy: Add explicit flushing feature. When Servlet container sends AJP
     body message with size 0, this means that Servlet container has asked for
     an explicit flush. Create flush bucket in that case. This feature has been
     added to the recent Tomcat versions without breaking the AJP protocol.
     [Mladen Turk]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Set the new environment variable BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED

     [Ruediger Pluem, Tomokazu Harada <harada sysrdc.ns-sol.co.jp>]

  *) mod_proxy_ajp: Added cping/cpong support for the AJP protocol.
     A new worker directive ping=timeout will cause CPING packet
     to be send expecting CPONG packet within defined timeout.  
     In case the backend is too busy this will fail instead
     sending the full header.  [Mladen Turk]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Make sure that only positive integers are accepted
     for the CacheMaxFileSize and CacheMinFileSize parameters in the
     config file. PR39380.  [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_cache: From RFC3986 (section 6.2.3.) if a URI contains an
     authority component and an empty path, the empty path is to be equivalent
     to "/". It explicitly cites the following four URIs as equivalents:
       http://example.com

       http://example.com:/
       http://example.com:80/
     [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) mod_cache: Don't cache requests with a expires date in the past;
     otherwise mod_cache will always try to cache the URL. This bug
     might lead to numerous rename() errors on win32 if the URL was
     previously cached. [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) core: Deal with the widespread use of apr_status_t return values
     as HTTP status codes, as documented in PR#31759 (a bug shared by

     token parser worked while the resulting length was misinterpreted.
     PR 29098.  [Brock Bland <bbland serena.com>]

  *) mod_isapi: Return 0 (failure) for more of the various ap_pass_brigade
     attempts to stream the response at the client.  Log these as well.

     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Workers can now be defined as part of
     a balancer cluster "set" in which members of a lower-numbered set
     are preferred over higher numbered ones.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Workers can now be defined as "hot standby" which
     will only be used if all other workers are unusable (eg: in
     error or disabled). Also, the balancer-manager displays the election
     count and I/O counts of all workers.  [Jim Jagielski]

     fails. PR 40310.  [Ian Abel <ianabel mxtelecom.com>]

     [Jari Ahonen jah progress.com, Brad Nicholes]
     
  *) Log the client IP address when an error occurs disabling nagle on a

  *) Major overhaul of mod_include's filter parser. The new parser code
     is expected to be more robust and should catch all of the edge cases
     that were not handled by the previous one. This includes a binary
     incompatible change of mod_include's external API.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_rewrite: Allow forced mimetypes [T=...] to get expanded.
     PR 14223.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix LA-U and LA-F lookups in directory context. Previously
     the current rewrite state was just used as lookup path, which lead to
     strange and often useless results. Related to PR 8493.  [André Malo]

  *) Change Listen directive to bind to all addresses when a hostname is
     not specified.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Correct failure with Listen directives on machines with IPv6 enabled.
     [Colm MacCárthaigh <colm stdlib.net>, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a link failure in mod_ssl when the OpenSSL libraries contain
     the ENGINE functions but the engine header files are missing.
     [Cliff Woolley]

  *) mod_rewrite: RewriteRules in server context using the force
     type feature [T=...] no longer disable MultiViews.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_rewrite: Allow piped rewrite logs to be relative to ServerRoot.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_authz_groupfile: Strip trailing spaces of group names. This
     hopefully saves some hours of searching for typos. PR 12863.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_actions: Propagate the handler name to the action script via
     the REDIRECT_HANDLER environment variable.  [André Malo]

  *) mod_actions: Introduce the "virtual" modifier to the Action directive,
     which allows the use of handlers for virtual locations. PR 8431.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_speling: Recognize AcceptPathInfo setting for the particular
     location. Default is to reject path information. PR 21059.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Add the ability to filter request bodies.
     [Philipp Reisner <philipp.reisner linbit.com>]

  *) Fix some broken log messages in WinNT MPM.  
     [Juan Rivera <Juan.Rivera citrix.com>]

  *) prefork MPM: Use the right permissions for the directory created 
     for gprof support.  [Jim Carlson <jcarlson jnous.com>]

  *) Fix a compile failure with recent OpenSSL and picky compilers
     (e.g., OpenSSL 0.9.7a and xlc_r on AIX).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) OpenSSL headers should be included as "openssl/ssl.h", and not rely on
     the INCLUDE path to be defined properly.
     PR 11310. [Geoff Thorpe <geoff geoffthorpe.net>]

  *) Modify APACHE_CHECK_SSL_TOOLKIT to detect SSL-C. [Madhusudan Mathihalli]

  *) Replace the APACHE_CHECK_SSL_TOOLKIT method with a cleaner one, using
     autoconf tools (AC_CHECK_HEADER, AC_CHECK_LIB etc). 
     [Geoff Thorpe <geoff geoffthorpe.net>]

  *) change directive name from 'compressionlevel' to 'deflatecompressionlevel'
     [Ian Holsman, André Malo]

  *) mod_negotiation: quality values are now parsed independent from
     the current locale. level values are now really parsed as integers.
     PR 17564.  [André Malo]

  *) Extend mod_negotiation to evaluate the environment variables
     no-gzip and gzip-only-text/html the same way as mod_deflate does.
     [André Malo]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix some problems reporting errors with mapping
     programs (RewriteMap prg:/something).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Return 413 if chunk-ext-header is too long rather than reading from
     the truncated line.  PR 15857.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Allow restart of httpd to occur even with syntax errors in the config
     file.  PR 16813.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Use APR_LAYOUT instead of APACHE_LAYOUT in configure.  PR 15679.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Remove files on 'make distclean' that should be.  PR 15592.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Allow apachectl to perform status with links and elinks as well.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) mod_log_config change optional hook to return previous handler
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) Forward port of mod_actions' ability to handle arbitrary methods
     with the Script directive.  [André Malo]

  *) Let suexec send a message to stderr, if it failed or its policy
     was violated. This message appears in the error log and allows
     for easier debugging. PR 5381, 7638, 8255, 10773.  [André Malo]

  *) Modify buildconf to copy all required files into httpd's tree.
     [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Allow mod_dav to do weak entity comparison functions.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Move RFC 1413 ident requests from core to new module mod_ident.
     [André Malo]

  *) Add mod_authz_owner - a forward port of "Require file-owner"
     and "Require file-group", which was already present in version
     1.3.21.  [André Malo]

  *) Add mod_dav_lock - a generic subset of the DAV locking implementation.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Replace some of the mutex locking in the worker MPM with
     atomic operations for higher concurrency.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Allow 'make depend' to work with non-GCC compilers.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) If an httpd.conf has commented out AddModule directives, 
     apxs -i -a will add an un-commented AddModule directive for 
     the new module, which breaks the config.
     PR: 11212 [Joe Orton]

  *) Fix mod_proxy handling of filtered input bodies.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Move the check of the Expect request header field after the hook
     for ap_post_read_request, since that is the only opportunity for
     modules to handle Expect extensions.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Rewrite of aaa modules to an authn/authz model.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Justin Erenkrantz]
