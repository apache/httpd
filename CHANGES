     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]

     redirects to "rewrite-redirect-handler" from "redirect-handler" so
     it is less ambiguous and less likely to be reused. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Protect against looping with the [N] flag by enforcing a

     needed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.

     like the SSL handshake where <If> LogLevel ... </If> is evaluated

     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.

     variables. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard

     to allow tracking of threads from exiting children via mod_status
     or other such mechanisms.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The following now respect DefaultRuntimeDir/DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR:
     - APIs: ap_log_pid(), ap_remove_pid, ap_read_pid()
     - core: the scoreboard (ScoreBoardFile), pid file (PidFile), and
       mutexes (Mutex)
     - mod_cache: thundering herd lock directory

     Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
     PR 51257. [Guenter Knauf]

  *) core: In maintainer mode, replace apr_palloc with a version that
     initializes the allocated memory with non-zero values, except if
     AP_DEBUG_NO_ALLOC_POISON is defined. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_policy: Add a new testing module to help server administrators
     enforce a configurable level of protocol compliance on their
     servers and application servers behind theirs. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_firehose: Add a new debugging module able to record traffic
     passing through the server in such a way that connections and/or
     requests be reconstructed and replayed. [Graham Leggett]
