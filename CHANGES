Changes with Apache 2.3.0

  *) mod_autoindex: Add in Type and Charset options to
     IndexOptions directive. This allows the admin to explicitly
     set the content-type and charset of the generated page.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mime.types: Many updates to sync with IANA registry and common
     unregistered types that the owners refuse to register.  Admins
     are encouraged to update their installed mime.types file.
     PR: 35550, 37798, 39317, 31483 [Roy T. Fielding]

  *) log core: ensure we use a special pool for stderr logging, so that
     the stderr channel remains valid from the time plog is destroyed,
     until the time the open_logs hook is called again.  [William Rowe]

  *) main core: Emit errors during the initial apr_app_initialize()
     or apr_pool_create() (when apr-based error reporting is not ready).
     [William Rowe, Jeff Trawick]

  *) mpm_winnt: Prevent the parent-child pipe from leaking into other
     spawned processes, and ensure we have a /Device/null handle for
     stdout when running as-a-service.  [William Rowe]

  *) log core: fix the new piped logger case where we couldn't connect 
     the replacement stderr logger's stderr to the NULL stdout stream.  
     Continue in this case, since the previous alternative of no error 
     logging at all (/dev/null) is far worse. [William Rowe]

  *) mod_ldap: Avoid possible crashes, hangs, and busy loops due to
     improper merging of the cache lock in vhost config
     PR 43164 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_negotiation: preserve Query String in resolving a type map
     PR 33112 [Jørgen Thomsen <apache jth.net>, Nick Kew]

  *) mod_deflate: fix content_encoding detection in inflate_out filter
     when it's not in response headers table.
     PR 42993 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy: Improve network performance by setting APR_TCP_NODELAY
     (disable Nagle algorithm) on sockets if implemented.
     PR 42871 [Christian BOITEL <christian_boitel yahoo.fr>, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_info: mod_info outputs invalid XHTML 1.0 transitional.
     PR 42847 [Rici Lake <rici ricilake.net>]

  *) mime.types: add registered Apple installer type
     PR 40379 [Peter Bierman <pmb+apache apple.com>]
   
  *) mod_ldap, mod_authnzldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
     to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
     where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
     PR 42891 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_deflate: don't try to process metadata buckets as data.  what should
     have been a 413 error was logged as a 500 and a blank screen appeared
     at the browser.
     [Greg Ames, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2007-3304 (cve.mitre.org)
     prefork, worker, event MPMs: Ensure that the parent process cannot
     be forced to kill processes outside its process group.  [Joe Orton]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2006-5752 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_status: Fix a possible XSS attack against a site with a public
     server-status page and ExtendedStatus enabled, for browsers which
     perform charset "detection".  Reported by Stefan Esser.  [Joe Orton]

  *) Event MPM: Add support for running under mod_ssl, by reverting to the
     Worker MPM behaviors, when run under an input filter that buffers
     its own data. [Paul Querna]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for caching SSL Sessions in memcached. [Paul Querna]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2007-1862 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_mem_cache: Copy headers into longer lived storage; header names and 
     values could previously point to cleaned up storage
     PR 41551 [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) mod_cache: Do not set Date or Expires when they are missing from
     the original response or are invalid.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) mod_cache: Correctly handle HEAD requests on expired cache content.
     PR 41230.  [Niklas Edmundsson]

  *) mod_proxy: Added ProxyPassMatch directive, which is similar
     to ProxyPass but takes a regex local path prefix. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_so: Solve dev's confusion by reporting expected/seen module
     magic signatures when failing with a 'garbled' message, and solve
     user's confusion by pointing out 'perhaps compiled for a different
     version of apache?'.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_substitute: Added a new experimental output filter, which
     performs inline response content pattern matching (including
     regex) and substitution.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_ssl: Version reporting update; displays 'compiled against'
     Apache and build-time SSL Library versions at loglevel [info],
     while reporting the run-time SSL Library version in the server
     info tags.  Helps to identify a mod_ssl built against one flavor
     of OpenSSL but running against another (also adds SSL-C version
     number reporting.)  [William Rowe]

  *) core: Change etag generation to produce identical results on 
     32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  PR 40064.  [Joe Orton]

  *) ab: Add -r option to continue after socket receive errors. 
     [Filip Hanik <devlist hanik.com>]

  *) mod_ldap: Fix the search limit parameter to ldap_search_ext_s()
     for SDKs that define LDAP_NO_LIMIT to something other than -1.
     [David Jones <oscaremma gmail.com>]

  *) mod_dbd: Introduce configuration groups to allow inheritance by virtual
     hosts of database configurations from the main server.  Determine the
     minimal set of distinct configurations and share connection pools
     whenever possible.  Allow virtual hosts to override inherited SQL
     statements.  PR 41302.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) core: Fix broken chunk filtering that causes all non blocking reads to be
     converted into blocking reads.  PR 41056. [Jean-Frederic Clere, Jim Jagielski]

  *) apxs: Enhance -q flag to print all known variables and their values
     when invoked without variable name(s). 
     [William Rowe, Sander Temme]

  *) mod_dbd: Create memory sub-pools for each DB connection and close
     DB connections in a pool cleanup function.  Ensure prepared statements
     are destroyed before DB connection is closed.  When using reslists,
     prevent segfaults when child processes exit, and stop memory leakage
     of ap_dbd_t structures.  Avoid use of global s->process->pool, which
     isn't destroyed by exiting child processes in most multi-process MPMs.
     PR 39985.  [Chris Darroch, Nick Kew]

  *) apxs: Eliminate run-time check for mod_so.  PR 40653.
     [David M. Lee <dmlee crossroads.com>]

  *) beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap_mpm_run() so that
     cleanups registered in modules' child_init hooks are performed.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_dbd: Handle error conditions in dbd_construct() properly.
     Simplify ap_dbd_open() and use correct arguments to apr_dbd_error()
     when non-threaded.  Register correct cleanup data in non-threaded
     ap_dbd_acquire() and ap_dbd_cacquire().  Clean up configuration data
     and merge function.  Use ap_log_error() wherever possible.
     [Chris Darroch, Nick Kew]

  *) core: Do not replace a Date header set by a proxied backend server.
     PR 40232. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure that at least scheme://hostname[:port] matches between
     worker and URL when searching for the best fitting worker for a given URL.
     PR 40910. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_cache: Remove expired content from cache that cannot be revalidated.
     PR 30370. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_dbd: Stash DBD connections in request_config of initial request
     only, or else sub-requests and internal redirections may cause
     entire DBD pool to be stashed in a single HTTP request.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_proxy: Add a missing assignment in an error checking code path.
     PR 40865. [Andrew Rucker Jones <arjones simultan.dyndns.org>]

  *) mod_mem_cache: Increase the minimum and default value for
     MCacheMinObjectSize from 0 to 1, as a MCacheMinObjectSize of 0 does not
     make sense and leads to a division by zero.  PR 40576.
     [Xuekun Hu <xuekun.hu gmail.com>]

  *) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
     on Win32.  PR 40476.  [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
     the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
     AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
     location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
     weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod_dbd. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]

  *) sendfile_nonblocking() takes the _brigade_ as an argument, gets 
     the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
     bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]

  *) ap_get_server_version() has been removed.  Third-party modules must 
     now use ap_get_server_banner() or ap_get_server_description().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) All MPMs: Introduce a check_config phase between pre_config and
     open_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
     directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
     to the console.  Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
     and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
     appropriate.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_proxy: don't URLencode tilde in path component
     [Stijn Hoop <stijn sandcat.nl>]

  *) mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
     The return value is index to the signaled thread in the
     creted_threads array. We can not use WAIT_TIMEOUT because
     his value is defined as 258, thus limiting the MaxThreads
     to that value. [Mladen Turk]

  *) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod_dir
     to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
     SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]

  *) mod_proxy: Support environment variable interpolation in reverse
     proxying directives. [Nick Kew]

  *) core: Add the filename of the configuration file to the warning message
     about the useless use of AllowOverride. PR 39992.
     [Darryl Miles <darryl darrylmiles.org>]

  *) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
     configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
     The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than 
     the typical administrator is prepared to untangle.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_disk_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
     within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_cache: Convert all values to seconds before comparing them when
     checking whether to send a Warning header for a stale response.
     PR 39713. [Owen Taylor <otaylor redhat.com>]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Delete temporary files if they cannot be renamed to their
     final name. [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) Worker and event MPMs: Remove improper scoreboard updates which were
     performed in the event of a fork() failure.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod_rewrite.
     [Markus Schiegl <ms schiegl.com>]

  *) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
     loading of worker_score structure with mod_status, and remove unused
     definitions relating to old life_status field.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb_score pointers
     in ap_init_scoreboard().  [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Add mod_proxy_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod_proxy.
     [Garrett Rooney, Jim Jagielski, Paul Querna]

  *) Event MPM: Fill in the scoreboard's tid field. PR 38736.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) mod_charset_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can 
     invalidate it.  Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix spurious hostname mismatch warning for valid
     wildcard certificates.  PR 37911.  [Nick Burch <nick torchbox.com>]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authn_core that will provide common
     authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'.  Move the directives
     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias 
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy' 
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide 
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as 
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>' 
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR' 
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the 
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz 
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and 
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked 
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to 
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
     [Martin Kraemer, David Reid]

     been applied to this cached entity before saving it to the cache are not
     applied again. PR 40090. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_cache: Correctly cache objects whose URL query string has been
     modified by mod_rewrite. PR 40805. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Change handling of ProxyErrorOverride such that
     3xx responses are no longer over-ridden (handling of 4xx and 5xx
     responses is unchanged).  PR 39245.
     [Jeff Trawick, Bart van der Schans <schans hippo.nl>]

  *) htdbm: Enable crypt support on platforms with crypt() but not
     <crypt.h>, such as z/OS. [David Jones <oscaremma gmail.com>]

  *) mod_ssl: initialize thread locks before initializing the hardware
     acceleration library, so the latter can make use of the former. 
     PR 20951. [adunn at ncipher.com]

     by creating a root pool for object persistence across requests. This
     also eliminates the need for custom serialization code.
     [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Add an AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute directive. If
     set, REMOTE_USER will be set to this attribute, rather than the

     of listen sockets in some configurations with multiple generic Listen
     directives.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_headers: Support regexp-based editing of HTTP headers.  [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy: Add explicit flushing feature. When Servlet container sends AJP
     body message with size 0, this means that Servlet container has asked for
     an explicit flush. Create flush bucket in that case. This feature has been
     added to the recent Tomcat versions without breaking the AJP protocol.
     [Mladen Turk]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Set the new environment variable BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED
     if a worker with a route different from the one supplied by the client
     had been chosen or if the client supplied no routing information for
     a balancer with sticky sessions. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_proxy_ajp: Added cping/cpong support for the AJP protocol.
     A new worker directive ping=timeout will cause CPING packet
     to be send expecting CPONG packet within defined timeout.
     In case the backend is too busy this will fail instead
     sending the full header.  [Mladen Turk]

  *) mod_cache: From RFC3986 (section 6.2.3.) if a URI contains an
     authority component and an empty path, the empty path is to be equivalent
