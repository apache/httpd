     require directives. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Remove the hardcoded algorithm-type dependency for the
     SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile directives, to enable
     future algorithm agility, and deprecate the SSLCertificateChainFile
     directive (obsoleted by SSLCertificateFile). [Kaspar Brand]

  *) mod_proxy: Remove <Proxy ~ wildcard-url> syntax which:
      - is equivalent to <ProxyMatch wildcard-url>
      - has never been documented
      - incorrectly checks parameters
      - is buggy
     [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) FreeBSD: Disable IPv4-mapped listening sockets by default for versions
     5+ instead of just for FreeBSD 5. PR 53824. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_auth_form: Add a debug message when the fields on a form are not
     recognised. [Graham Leggett]

     configured SSL CA certificates to stdout the same way as DUMP_CERTS does.
     [Jan Kaluza]

  *) mod_cache_disk: Fix potential hangs on Windows when using mod_cache_disk. 
     PR55833. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_headers: Allow the "value" parameter of Header and RequestHeader to 
     contain an ap_expr expression if prefixed with "expr=". [Eric Covener]

  *) Add suspend_connection and resume_connection hooks to notify modules
     when the thread/connection relationship changes.  (Currently implemented
     only for the Event MPM; should be implemented for all async MPMs.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ssl: Don't flush when an EOS is received. Prepares mod_ssl
     to support write completion. [Graham Leggett]

     PR 54852 [Jim Jagielski, Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <arekm maven pl>]

  *) core: Add parse_errorlog_arg callback to ap_errorlog_provider
     to allow providers to check the ErrorLog argument. [Jan Kaluza]

     PR 55670 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy: Added support for unix domain sockets as the
     backend server endpoint [Jim Jagielski, Blaise Tarr
     <blaise tarr gmail com>]

  *) mod_auth_form: Make sure the optional functions are loaded even when
     the AuthFormProvider isn't specified. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_lua: Let the Inter-VM get/set functions work with a global 
     shared memory pool instead of a per-process pool. [Daniel Gruno]

  *) ldap: Support ldaps when using the Microsoft LDAP SDK.
     PR 54626. [Jean-Frederic Clere]

  *) mod_proxy: Add ap_connection_reusable() for checking if a connection
     is reusable as of this point in processing.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Change default value of AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth to 0
     to avoid performance problems when subgroups aren't in use. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_syslog: New module implementing syslog ap_error_log provider.
     Previously, this code was part of core, now it's in separate module.
     [Jan Kaluza]

  *) core: Add ap_errorlog_provider to make ErrorLog logging modular. Move
     syslog support from core to new mod_syslog. [Jan Kaluza]

  *) core: draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-23 corrections regarding
     TE/CL conflicts. [Yann Ylavic <ylavic.dev gmail com>, Jim Jagielski]
     
  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Use apr_socket_timeout_get instead of hard-coded

     APR_SO_DISCONNECTED socket. Restores 2.2 behavior. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_lua: Add a logging hook for modifying/skipping logs. [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_status, mod_echo: Fix the display of client addresses.
     They were truncated to 31 characters which is not enough for IPv6 addresses.
     PR 54848 [Bernhard Schmidt <berni birkenwald de>]

  *) mod_lua: If the first yield() of a LuaOutputFilter returns a string, it should
     be prefixed to the response as documented. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_lua: Remove ETAG, Content-Length, and Content-MD5 when a LuaOutputFilter
     is configured without mod_filter. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_lua: Register LuaOutputFilter scripts as changing the content and
     content-length by default, when run my mod_filter.  Previously,
     growing or shrinking a response that started with Content-Length set
     would require mod_filter and FilterProtocol change=yes. [Eric Covnener]

  *) mod_lua: Return a 500 error if a LuaHook* script doesn't return a 
     numeric return code. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_authnz_fcgi: New module to enable FastCGI authorizer
     applications to authenticate and/or authorize clients.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) core: Add ap_log_data(), ap_log_rdata(), etc. for logging buffers.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_unique_id: Use output of the PRNG rather than IP address and
     pid, avoiding sleep() call and possible DNS issues at startup,
     plus improving randomness for IPv6-only hosts.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Support primitive LDAP servers that do not accept
     filters, such as "SDBM-backed LDAP" on z/OS, by allowing a special
     filter "none" to be specified in AuthLDAPURL. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_file_cache: mod_file_cache should be able to serve files that
     haven't had a Content-Type set via e.g. mod_mime. [Eric Covener]

  *) core: merge AllowEncodedSlashes from the base configuration into
     virtual hosts. [Eric Covener]

  *) AIX: Install DSO's with "cp" instead of "install" in instdso.sh
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ldap: Don't keep retrying if a new LDAP connection times out.
     [Eric Covener]

     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_socache_shmcb.c: Remove arbitrary restriction on shared memory size
     previously limited to 64MB. [Jens Låås <jelaas gmail.com>]

  *) mod_auth_digest: Use the secret when generating nonces in all cases and
     not only when AuthName is used in .htaccess files (this change may cause
     problems if used with round robin load balancers). Don't regenerate the
     secret on graceful restarts. PR 54637  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Remove apr_brigade_flatten(), buffering and duplicated code
     from the HTTP_IN filter, parse chunks in a single pass with zero copy.
     Reduce memory usage by 48 bytes per request. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Stop the HTTP_IN filter from attempting to write error buckets
     to the output filters, which is bogus in the proxy case. Create a
     clean mapping from APR codes to HTTP status codes, and use it where
     needed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be
     compliant with RFC2616 14.9.4 Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls.

  *) mod_dav: mod_dav overrides dav_fs response on PUT failure. PR 35981
     [Basant Kumar Kukreja <basant.kukreja sun.com>, Alejandro Alvarez
     <alejandro.alvarez.ayllon cern.ch>]

  *) core, mod_ssl: Enable the ability for a module to reverse the sense of
     a poll event from a read to a write or vice versa. This is a step on
     the way to allow mod_ssl taking full advantage of the event MPM.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ldap: LDAP connections used for authentication were not respecting
     LDAPConnectionPoolTimeout.  PR 54587

  *) core: ap_rgetline_core now pulls from r->proto_input_filters.

  *) mod_proxy_html: process parsed comments immediately. 
     Fixes bug where parsed comments may be lost. [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: introduce doctype for HTML 5 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix typo-bug processing "strict" vs "transitional"
     HTML/XHTML [Nick Kew]

  *) core: Add option to add valgrind support. Use it to reduce false positive
     warnings in mod_ssl. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) http: Remove support for Request-Range header sent by Navigator 2-3 and
     MSIE 3. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core, http: Extend HttpProtocol with an option to enforce stricter HTTP
     conformance or to only log the found problems. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Correctly parse an IPv6 literal host specification in an absolute
     URL in the request line. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for OpenSSL configuration commands [Stephen Henson]

  *) EventOpt MPM

  *) core: Add LogLevelOverride directive that allows to override the
     loglevel for clients from certain IPs. This also works for things
     like the SSL handshake where <If> LogLevel ... </If> is evaluated
     too late. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Add new directive Warning to issue warnings from a configuration
     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.
     [Fabien Coelho] 

  *) ap_expr: Add SERVER_PROTOCOL_VERSION, ..._MAJOR, and ..._MINOR
     variables. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard
     HTTP methods. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive HttpProtocol which allows to disable HTTP/0.9
     support. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_allowhandlers: New module to forbid specific handlers for specific
     directories. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_systemd: New module, for integration with systemd on Linux.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) WinNT MPM: Store pid and generation for each thread in scoreboard
     to allow tracking of threads from exiting children via mod_status
     or other such mechanisms.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The following now respect DefaultRuntimeDir/DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR:
     - APIs: ap_log_pid(), ap_remove_pid, ap_read_pid()
     - core: the scoreboard (ScoreBoardFile), pid file (PidFile), and
       mutexes (Mutex)
     - mod_cache: thundering herd lock directory
     - mod_lbmethod_heartbeat, mod_heartmonitor: heartbeat storage file
     - mod_ldap: shared memory cache
     - mod_socache_shmcb, mod_socache_dbm: shared memory or dbm for cache
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) suexec: Add --enable-suexec-capabilites support on Linux, to use
     setuid/setgid capability bits rather than a setuid root binary.
     [Joe Orton]

  *) suexec: Add support for logging to syslog as an alternative to logging
     to a file; configure --without-suexec-logfile --with-suexec-syslog.  
     [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for TLS Next Protocol Negotiation.  PR 52210.
     [Matthew Steele <mdsteele google.com>]

  *) cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will
     be compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
     Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
     PR 51257. [Guenter Knauf]

  *) core: In maintainer mode, replace apr_palloc with a version that
     initializes the allocated memory with non-zero values, except if
     AP_DEBUG_NO_ALLOC_POISON is defined. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_policy: Add a new testing module to help server administrators
     enforce a configurable level of protocol compliance on their
     servers and application servers behind theirs. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_firehose: Add a new debugging module able to record traffic
     passing through the server in such a way that connections and/or
     requests be reconstructed and replayed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_noloris

  *) APREQ

  *) Simple MPM

  *) mod_serf
