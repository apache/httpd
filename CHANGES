Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) mod_http2: fix for crash when running out of memory.

  *) mod_ssl: work around leaks on (graceful) restart. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) When using mod_status with the Event MPM, report the number of requests
     associated with an active connection in the "ACC" field. Previously
     zero was always reported with this MPM.  PR60647. [Eric Covener]

  *) core: %{DOCUMENT_URI} used in nested SSI expressions should point to the
     URI originally requsted by the user, not the nested documents URI. This
     restores the behavior of this variable to match the "legacy" SSI parser.
     PR60624. [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_hcheck: Don't validate timed out responses.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_hcheck: Ensure thread-safety when concurrent healthchecks are
     in use (ProxyHCTPsize > 0).  PR 60071.  [Yann Ylavic, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Return to 2.4.20-and-earlier behavior of leaving 
     a "proxy:fcgi://" prefix in the SCRIPT_FILENAME environment variable by 
     default.  Add ProxyFCGIBackendType to allow the type of backend to be
     specified so these kinds of fixups can be restored without impacting
     FPM. PR60576 [Eric Covener]

  *) Don't set SO_REUSEPORT unless ListenCoresBucketsRatio is greater
     than zero.  [Eric Covener]

  *) core: EBCDIC fixes for interim responses with additional headers.
     [Eric Covener]

     See also: http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
     [Cloudzilla/roadrunner2@GitHub, Jim Jagielski, Daniel Ruggeri]

  *) mod_rewrite: When a substitution is a fully qualified URL, and the 
     scheme/host/port matches the current virtual host, stop interpreting the 
     path component as a local path just because the first component of the 
     path exists in the filesystem.  Adds RewriteOption "LegacyPrefixDocRoot" 
     to revert to previous behavior. PR60009.
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]
 
  *) core: Add %{REMOTE_PORT} to the expression parser. PR59938
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

     when available.  PR 57399.  [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano]

  *) mod_brotli: Add a new module for dynamic Brotli (RFC 7932) compression.
     [Evgeny Kotkov]

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Drop an invalid Last-Modified header value coming
     from a FCGI/CGI script instead of replacing it with Unix epoch.
     Warn the users about Last-Modified header value replacements
     and violations of the RFC.
     [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano, William Rowe, Jacob Champion]

  *) mod_dav: Allow other modules to become providers and add ACLs

     network filter to any connection or request filter. [Graham Leggett]

     [Graham Leggett]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Define and UnDefine are no longer permitted in
     directory context. Previously they would always be evaulated

     context. [Eric Covener]

  *) config: For directives that do not expect any arguments, enforce
     that none are specified in the configuration file. 
     [Joachim Zobel <jzobel heute-morgen.de>, Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy: Don't put non balancer-member workers in error state by
     default for connection or 500/503 errors, and honor status=+I for

  *) mod_socache_memcache: Pass expiration time through to memcached. PR 55445.
     [Faidon Liambotis <paravoid debian.org>, Joe Orton]

     [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Resolve crashes with LDAP authz and non-LDAP authn since 
     r1608202. [Eric Covener]

  *) apreq: Content-Length header should be always interpreted as a decimal.
     Leading 0 could be erroneously considered as an octal value. PR 56598.
     [Chris Card <ctcard hotmail com>]

  *) mod_proxy: Now allow for 191 character worker names, with non-fatal
     errors if name is truncated. PR53218. [Jim Jagielski]

     when passed to 'connect()'.
     [Graham Dumpleton <grahamd apache org>]

     to resume. PR56333 
     [Artem <artemciy gmail.com>, Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]

  *) core: Add ap_mpm_register_socket_callback_timeout() API. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Honor ProxyWebsocketIdleTimeout in asynchronous
     processing mode. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Fail explicitly when the filter is too long. Remove
     unnecessary apr_pstrdup() and strlen(). [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]

     of time a synchronous websockets connection stays idle with 
     ProxyWebsocketIdleTimeout. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Change to opt-in for asynchronous support, adding 
     directives ProxyWebsocketAsync and ProxyWebsocketAsyncDelay. 
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Stop leaking websockets backend connections under
     event MPM (trunk-only). [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Add detach_backend hook (potentially usable
     in other proxy scheme handlers).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_deflate: Add DeflateAlterETag to control how the ETag
     is modified. The 'NoChange' parameter mimics 2.2.x behavior.
     PR 45023, PR 39727. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Add 'BNF' (backreferences-no-plus) flag to RewriteRule to 
     allow spaces in backreferences to be encoded as %20 instead of '+'.

     argument for the 'B' (escape backreferences) flag. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Rename the handler that does per-directory internal 
     redirects to "rewrite-redirect-handler" from "redirect-handler" so
     it is less ambiguous and less likely to be reused. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_cgid: Use the servers Timeout for each read from a CGI script,
     allow override with new CGIDRequestTimeout directive. PR43494
     [Eric Covener, Toshikuni Fukaya <toshikuni-fukaya cybozu co jp>]

  *) core: ensure any abnormal exit is reported to stderr if it's a tty.
