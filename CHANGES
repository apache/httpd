Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) core: Remove apr_brigade_flatten(), buffering and duplicated code
     from the HTTP_IN filter, parse chunks in a single pass with zero copy.
     Reduce memory usage by 48 bytes per request. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_deflate: Remove assumptions as to when an EOS bucket might arrive.
     Gracefully step aside if the body size is zero. [Graham Leggett]

  *) 'AuthGroupFile' and 'AuthUserFile' do not accept anymore the optional
     'standard' keyword . It was unused and not documented.
     PR54463 [Tianyin Xu <tixu cs.ucsd.edu> and Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Make the proxy-interim-response environment variable
     effective by formally overriding origin server behaviour. [Graham
     Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) core: Stop the HTTP_IN filter from attempting to write error buckets
     to the output filters, which is bogus in the proxy case. Create a
     clean mapping from APR codes to HTTP status codes, and use it where
     needed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure we don't attempt to amend a table we are iterating
     through, ensuring that all headers listed by Connection are removed.
     [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) core: apachectl -S prints wildcard name-based virtual hosts twice. 
     PR54948 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy: Reject invalid values for Max-Forwards. [Graham Leggett,
     Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_cache: If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then
     the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the
     conditional. [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix seg-faults when using the global pool on threaded
     MPMs [Thomas Eckert <thomas.r.w.eckert gmail.com>, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be
     compliant with RFC2616 14.9.4 Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls.
     [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_cache: Ensure that we don't attempt to replace a cached response
     with an older response as per RFC2616 13.12. [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor
     <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) core, mod_cache: Ensure RFC2616 compliance in ap_meets_conditions()
     with weak validation combined with If-Range and Range headers. Break
     out explicit conditional header checks to be useable elsewhere in the
     server. Ensure weak validation RFC compliance in the byteranges filter.
     Ensure RFC validation compliance when serving cached entities. PR 16142
     [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) core: Add the ability to do explicit matching on weak and strong ETags
     as per RFC2616 Section 13.3.3. [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor
     <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_cache: Ensure that updated responses to HEAD requests don't get
     mistakenly paired with a previously cached body. Ensure that any existing
     body is removed when a HEAD request is cached. [Graham Leggett,
     Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_cache: Honour Cache-Control: no-store in a request. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: RFC2616 14.9.3 The s-maxage directive also implies the
     semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Make sure that contradictory entity headers present in a 304
     Not Modified response are caught and cause the entity to be removed.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Make sure Vary processing handles multivalued Vary headers and
     multivalued headers referred to via Vary. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: When serving from cache, only the last header of a multivalued
     header was taken into account. Fixed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Ignore response headers specified by no-cache=header and
     private=header as specified by RFC2616 14.9.1 What is Cacheable. Ensure
     that these headers are still processed when multiple Cache-Control
     headers are present in the response. PR 54706 [Graham Leggett,
     Yann Ylavic <ylavic.dev gmail.com>]

     PR 52559 [Diego Santa Cruz <diego.santaCruz spinetix.com>]

  *) mod_dav: When a PROPPATCH attempts to remove a non-existent dead
     property on a resource for which there is no dead property in the same
     namespace httpd segfaults. PR 52559 [Diego Santa Cruz
     <diego.santaCruz spinetix.com>]

  *) mod_dav: PROPPATCH delete (svn propdel) silently discards errors.
     PR 53525 [Arwin Arni <arwin collab.net>]

  *) mod_dav: Ensure URI is correctly uriencoded on return. PR 54611
     [Timothy Wood <tjw omnigroup.com>]

  *) mod_dav: Sending a If or If-Match header with an invalid ETag doesn't
     result in a 412 Precondition Failed. PR 54610 [Timothy Wood
     <tjw omnigroup.com>]

  *) mod_dav: Make sure that when we prepare an If URL for Etag comparison,
     we compare unencoded paths. PR 53910 [Timothy Wood <tjw omnigroup.com>]

  *) core, mod_ssl: Lift the restriction that prevents mod_ssl taking
     full advantage of the event MPM. Enable the ability for a module
     to reverse the sense of a poll event from a read to a write or vice
     versa. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix typo-bug processing "strict" vs "transitional"
     HTML/XHTML [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_lua: Add bindings for apr_dbd/mod_dbd database access
     [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.

     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.

     a status code to the client (such as a 302 or a 500) [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_lua: Decline handling 'lua-script' if the file doesn't exist,
     rather than throwing an internal server error. [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_lua: Add functions r:flush and r:sendfile as well as additional
     request information to the request_rec structure. [Daniel Gruno]

     [Matthew Steele <mdsteele google.com>]
