     Log only cookies with a value assignment.
     [William Rowe, Ruediger Pluem, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_ssl: Do not perform SNI / Host header comparison in case of a
     forward proxy request. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_lua: Add r:wspeek for checking if there is any data waiting on the line
     [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_rewrite: Rename the handler that does per-directory internal 
     redirects to "rewrite-redirect-handler" from "redirect-handler" so
     it is less ambiguous and less likely to be reused. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Protect against looping with the [N] flag by enforcing a 
     default limit of 10000 iterations, and allowing each rule to change its
     limit. [Eric Covener]

     SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile directives, to enable
     future algorithm agility, and deprecate the SSLCertificateChainFile
     directive (obsoleted by SSLCertificateFile). [Kaspar Brand]

     5+ instead of just for FreeBSD 5. PR 53824. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_auth_form: Add a debug message when the fields on a form are not

     contain an ap_expr expression if prefixed with "expr=". [Eric Covener]

  *) Add suspend_connection and resume_connection hooks to notify modules

     only for the Event MPM; should be implemented for all async MPMs.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_ssl: Don't flush when an EOS is received. Prepares mod_ssl
     to support write completion. [Graham Leggett]

     PR 54852 [Jim Jagielski, Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <arekm maven pl>]

     the AuthFormProvider isn't specified. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_lua: Let the Inter-VM get/set functions work with a global 
     shared memory pool instead of a per-process pool. [Daniel Gruno]

  *) ldap: Support ldaps when using the Microsoft LDAP SDK.
     PR 54626. [Jean-Frederic Clere]

     is reusable as of this point in processing.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Change default value of AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth to 0
     to avoid performance problems when subgroups aren't in use. [Eric Covener]

     Previously, this code was part of core, now it's in separate module.
     [Jan Kaluza]

  *) core: Add ap_errorlog_provider to make ErrorLog logging modular. Move
     syslog support from core to new mod_syslog. [Jan Kaluza]

  *) core: draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-23 corrections regarding
     TE/CL conflicts. [Yann Ylavic <ylavic.dev gmail com>, Jim Jagielski]
     
  *) WinNT MPM: If ap_run_pre_connection() fails or sets c->aborted, don't
     save the socket for reuse by the next worker as if it were an 
     APR_SO_DISCONNECTED socket. Restores 2.2 behavior. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_status, mod_echo: Fix the display of client addresses.
     They were truncated to 31 characters which is not enough for IPv6 addresses.
     PR 54848 [Bernhard Schmidt <berni birkenwald de>]

     applications to authenticate and/or authorize clients.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) core: Add ap_log_data(), ap_log_rdata(), etc. for logging buffers.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_unique_id: Use output of the PRNG rather than IP address and

     plus improving randomness for IPv6-only hosts.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Support primitive LDAP servers that do not accept
     filters, such as "SDBM-backed LDAP" on z/OS, by allowing a special
     filter "none" to be specified in AuthLDAPURL. [Eric Covener]

     previously limited to 64MB. [Jens Låås <jelaas gmail.com>]

  *) mod_auth_digest: Use the secret when generating nonces in all cases and
     not only when AuthName is used in .htaccess files (this change may cause

     secret on graceful restarts. PR 54637  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Remove apr_brigade_flatten(), buffering and duplicated code
     from the HTTP_IN filter, parse chunks in a single pass with zero copy.
     Reduce memory usage by 48 bytes per request. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Stop the HTTP_IN filter from attempting to write error buckets
     to the output filters, which is bogus in the proxy case. Create a
     clean mapping from APR codes to HTTP status codes, and use it where
     needed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be
     compliant with RFC2616 14.9.4 Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls.

  *) mod_dav: mod_dav overrides dav_fs response on PUT failure. PR 35981
     [Basant Kumar Kukreja <basant.kukreja sun.com>, Alejandro Alvarez
     <alejandro.alvarez.ayllon cern.ch>]

  *) core, mod_ssl: Enable the ability for a module to reverse the sense of
     a poll event from a read to a write or vice versa. This is a step on
     the way to allow mod_ssl taking full advantage of the event MPM.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ldap: LDAP connections used for authentication were not respecting
     LDAPConnectionPoolTimeout.  PR 54587

  *) core: ap_rgetline_core now pulls from r->proto_input_filters.

  *) mod_proxy_html: process parsed comments immediately. 
     Fixes bug where parsed comments may be lost. [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: introduce doctype for HTML 5 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix typo-bug processing "strict" vs "transitional"
     HTML/XHTML [Nick Kew]

  *) core: Add option to add valgrind support. Use it to reduce false positive
     warnings in mod_ssl. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
     keep-alive connection. This saves some expensive calculations.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) http: Remove support for Request-Range header sent by Navigator 2-3 and
     MSIE 3. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core, http: Extend HttpProtocol with an option to enforce stricter HTTP
     conformance or to only log the found problems. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Correctly parse an IPv6 literal host specification in an absolute
     URL in the request line. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) EventOpt MPM

  *) core: Add LogLevelOverride directive that allows to override the
     loglevel for clients from certain IPs. This also works for things
     like the SSL handshake where <If> LogLevel ... </If> is evaluated
     too late. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Add new directive Warning to issue warnings from a configuration
     file. Both Warning and Error now generate a timestamped log message.
     [Fabien Coelho] 

  *) ap_expr: Add SERVER_PROTOCOL_VERSION, ..._MAJOR, and ..._MINOR
     variables. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive RegisterHttpMethod for registering non-standard
     HTTP methods. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: New directive HttpProtocol which allows to disable HTTP/0.9
     support. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_allowhandlers: New module to forbid specific handlers for specific
     directories. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_systemd: New module, for integration with systemd on Linux.
     [Jan Kaluza <jkaluza redhat.com>]

  *) WinNT MPM: Store pid and generation for each thread in scoreboard
     to allow tracking of threads from exiting children via mod_status
     or other such mechanisms.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The following now respect DefaultRuntimeDir/DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR:
     - APIs: ap_log_pid(), ap_remove_pid, ap_read_pid()
     - core: the scoreboard (ScoreBoardFile), pid file (PidFile), and
       mutexes (Mutex)
     - mod_cache: thundering herd lock directory
     - mod_lbmethod_heartbeat, mod_heartmonitor: heartbeat storage file
     - mod_ldap: shared memory cache
     - mod_socache_shmcb, mod_socache_dbm: shared memory or dbm for cache
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) suexec: Add --enable-suexec-capabilites support on Linux, to use
     setuid/setgid capability bits rather than a setuid root binary.
     [Joe Orton]

  *) suexec: Add support for logging to syslog as an alternative to logging
     to a file; configure --without-suexec-logfile --with-suexec-syslog.  
     [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for TLS Next Protocol Negotiation.  PR 52210.
     [Matthew Steele <mdsteele google.com>]

  *) cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will
     be compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
     Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
     PR 51257. [Guenter Knauf]

  *) core: In maintainer mode, replace apr_palloc with a version that
     initializes the allocated memory with non-zero values, except if
     AP_DEBUG_NO_ALLOC_POISON is defined. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_policy: Add a new testing module to help server administrators
     enforce a configurable level of protocol compliance on their
     servers and application servers behind theirs. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_firehose: Add a new debugging module able to record traffic
     passing through the server in such a way that connections and/or
     requests be reconstructed and replayed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_noloris

  *) APREQ

  *) Simple MPM

  *) mod_serf
