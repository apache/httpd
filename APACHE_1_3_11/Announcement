Apache 1.3.11 Released
======================

The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.11 of the Apache HTTP server.
Apache 1.3.10 was not released due to a last-minute bug found and
fixed after the source was tagged and tested.

This new Apache version incorporates numerous significant improvements
to the server.  Apart from portability and security fixes, documentation
enhancements, performance improvements, and assorted other minor
features or fixes notable changes are:

   - Binary and shared builds on several platforms have been
     improved.

   - The time that a parent waits for its children to die
     after SIGKILL has been sent has been reduced.

   - Various suexec improvements.

   - More rigorous checking of Host: headers to fix security problems
     with mass name-based virtual hosting.

   - Addition of the  %q logging format directive (logs "?" and the query
     string part of a query, or the empty string if no query).

   - Improvement of the OS390 port.

   - Several EBCDIC fixes.

   - Better error reporting during the "compiler sanity" check.

   - Fixed the `quad integer' (aka `long long') handling in ap_snprintf.c

   - mod_rewrite's general substitution function was overhauled.

   - Several WIN32 bugs have been fixed, including:
     - CGIs broken if script calls other programs which deliver on stdout
       (Search this file for "DETACHED")
     - 16 bit CGIs should work now
     - Server will not start if passed the -d option with spaces in the
       argument.

A complete listing with detailed descriptions is provided in the
src/CHANGES file.

We consider Apache 1.3.11 to be the best version of Apache available and
we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of the
1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further releases
will be made in the 1.2.x family.


Apache 1.3.11 is available for download from

    http://www.apache.org/dist/

Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full
list of changes.

Binary distributions are available from

   http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/

As of Apache 1.3.11 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
mirrors listed at

    http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

For an overview of new features in 1.3 please see

    http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements
over version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a
wider range of supported platforms, including Windows 95/98 and NT
(which fall under the "Win32" label).

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
its variants.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have
come to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must
be realized that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the
levels of the Unix version, but is of acceptable quality. Any
Win32 stability or security problems do not impact, in any way,
Apache on other platforms.  With the continued donation of time
and resources by individuals and companies, we hope that the Win32
version of Apache will grow stronger through the 1.3.x release cycle.


Thank you for using Apache.
