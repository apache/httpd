      <STRONG>What is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache was originally based on code and ideas found in the most
  popular HTTP server of the time.. NCSA httpd 1.3 (early 1995). It has
  since evolved into a far superior system which can rival (and probably
  surpass) almost any other UNIX based HTTP server in terms of functionality,
  efficiency and speed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Since it began, it has been completely rewritten, and includes many new
  features. Apache is, as of January 1997, the most popular WWW server on
  the Internet, according to the
  <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/Survey/">Netcraft Survey</A>.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="why">
      <STRONG>Why was Apache created?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  To address the concerns of a group of WWW providers and part-time httpd
  programmers that httpd didn't behave as they wanted it to behave.
  Apache is an entirely volunteer effort, completely funded by its
  members, not by commercial sales.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="relate">
      <STRONG>How does The Apache Group's work relate to other
      server efforts, such as NCSA's?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  We, of course, owe a great debt to NCSA and their programmers for
  making the server Apache was based on. We now, however, have our own
  server, and our project is mostly our own. The Apache Project is an
  entirely independent venture.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="name">
      <STRONG>Why the name &quot;Apache&quot;?</STRONG>
      </A>
  <P>
  A cute name which stuck. Apache is &quot;<STRONG>A
  PA</STRONG>t<STRONG>CH</STRONG>y server&quot;.  It was
  based on some existing code and a series of &quot;patch files&quot;.
  </P>

  <P>
  For many developers it is also a reverant connotation to the Native
  American Indian tribe of Apache, <A
  HREF="http://www.indians.org/welker/apache.htm">well-known for their
  superior skills in warfare strategy and inexhaustible endurance</A>.
  Online information about the Apache Nation is tough to locate; we 
  suggest searching 
  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=Apache+Nation">Google</A>, 
  <A HREF="http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?qr=Apache+Nation">Northernlight</A>,

 <LI><A NAME="compare">
      <STRONG>OK, so how does Apache compare to other servers?</STRONG>

  For an independent assessment, see

  comparison chart.

  Apache has been shown to be substantially faster than many other
  free servers. Although certain commercial servers have claimed to
  surpass Apache's speed (it has not been demonstrated that any of these
  &quot;benchmarks&quot; are a good way of measuring WWW server speed at any
  rate), we feel that it is better to have a mostly-fast free server
  than an extremely-fast server that costs thousands of dollars. Apache
  is run on sites that get millions of hits per day, and they have
  experienced no performance difficulties.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="tested">
      <STRONG>How thoroughly tested is Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache is run on over 3 million Internet servers (as of June 1999). It has
  been tested thoroughly by both developers and users. The Apache Group
  maintains rigorous standards before releasing new versions of their
  server, and our server runs without a hitch on over one half of all
  WWW servers available on the Internet.  When bugs do show up, we
  release patches and new versions as soon as they are available.
  </P>
  <P>
  The Apache project's web site includes a page with a partial list of
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/info/apache_users.html">sites running
  Apache</A>.

 <LI><A NAME="future">

  <P>
  <UL>
   <LI>to continue to be an "open source" no-charge-for-use HTTP server,
   </LI>
   <LI>to keep up with advances in HTTP protocol and web developments in
    general,

  <HR>
 </LI>

 <LI><A NAME="support">
      <STRONG>Whom do I contact for support?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  There is no official support for Apache. None of the developers want to
  be swamped by a flood of trivial questions that can be resolved elsewhere.
  Bug reports and suggestions should be sent <EM>via</EM>
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html">the bug report page</A>.
  Other questions should be directed to the
  <A HREF="news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix"
  >comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</A> or <A HREF=
  "news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows"
  >comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows</A>
  newsgroup (as appropriate for the platform you use), where some of the 
  Apache team lurk, in the company of many other httpd gurus who 
  should be able to help.
  </P>
  <P>
  Commercial support for Apache is, however, available from a number
  of third parties.

 <LI><A NAME="more">

      Apache?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Indeed there is.  See the main
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache web site</A>.
  There is also a regular electronic publication called
  <A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/" REL="Help"><CITE>Apache Week</CITE></A>
  available.  Links to relevant <CITE>Apache Week</CITE> articles are
  included below where appropriate. There are also some 
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/info/apache_books.html"
  >Apache-specific books</A> available.

  You can find out how to download the source for Apache at the
