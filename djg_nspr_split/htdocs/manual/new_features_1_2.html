<H2>API Changes</H2>

<P>Some non-compatible changes were made to the Apache API in order to
deal with HTTP/1.1 compatibility.  It is possible that some modules
will no longer work (specifically, those that process input using the
POST or PUT methods). If you encounter a module that does not work,
please contact the author. A <A
HREF="misc/client_block_api.html">programmer's note</A> on the subject is
available.</P>

<P>Additionally, some changes were made to the CGI environment that
may cause some CGI scripts to work incorrectly. If you are
experiencing trouble with a CGI that worked fine under Apache 1.1.1,
please see <A HREF="cgi_path.html">our explanation of the changes.</A></P>

<H2>New Features with Apache 1.2</H2>
<P>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the <A
HREF="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</A> if you have any
problems.</P>
<HR>

<P>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Apache
1.2</A> has the following specific new user features:</P>

<LI><STRONG><A name="http11.html">HTTP/1.1 Compliance</A></STRONG>
[Documentation to be written]<BR>
Aside from the optional proxy module (which operates as HTTP/1.0),
Apache is conditionally compliant with the HTTP/1.1 proposed standard,
as approved by the IESG and the
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/">IETF HTTP working group</A>.
HTTP/1.1 provides a much-improved protocol, and
should allow for greater performance and efficiency when transferring
files. Apache does, however, still work great with HTTP/1.0 browsers.
We are very close to being unconditionally compliant; if you note any
deviance from the proposed standard, please report it as a bug.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_include.html">eXtended Server Side Includes
(XSSI)</A></STRONG><BR>
A new set of server-side include
directives allows the user to better create WWW pages. This includes
number of powerful new features, such as the ability to set variables
and use conditional HTML.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#files">File-based and Regex-enabled
Directive Sections</A></STRONG><BR>
The new
<A HREF="mod/core.html#files"><CODE>&lt;Files&gt;</CODE></A>
section allows directives to be enabled based on full filename, not just directory and URL. In
addition, <CODE>&lt;Files&gt;</CODE> sections can appear in
<CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files. <CODE>&lt;Files&gt;</CODE>, along with
<A HREF="mod/core.html#directory"><CODE>&lt;Directory&gt;</CODE></A>
 and <A HREF="mod/core.html#location"><CODE>&lt;Location&gt;</CODE></A>, can
also now be based on regular expressions, not just simple prefix
matching.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_browser.html">Browser-based Environment
Variables</A></STRONG><BR>
Environment variables can now be set based on the
<CODE>User-Agent</CODE> string of the browser. Combined with <A
HREF="mod/mod_include.html">XSSI</A>, this allows you to write browser-based
conditional HTML documents.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="suexec.html">SetUID CGI Execution</A></STRONG><BR>
    Apache now
    supports the execution of CGI scripts as users other
    than the server user. A number of security checks are built in
    to try and make this as safe as possible.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_rewrite.html">URL Rewriting Module</A></STRONG><BR>
The optional <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE> module is now included. This
module can provide powerful URL mapping, using regular
expressions. There's nothing this module can't do!

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html">Enhanced, Configurable
Logging</A></STRONG><BR>
The optional <CODE>mod_log_config</CODE> included with earlier
versions of Apache is now standard, and has been enhanced to allow
logging of much more detail about the transaction, and can be used to
open <A HREF="multilogs.html">more than one log file</A> at once
(each of which can have a different log format).  If you have Apache
write any logs to a directory which is writable by anyone other than
the user that starts the server, see the <A HREF="misc/security_tips.html">
security tips</A> document to be sure you aren't putting the security
of your server at risk.


<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_usertrack.html">User Tracking (Cookies)
Revisions</A></STRONG><BR>
The <CODE>mod_cookies</CODE> included with previous versions of Apache
has been renamed <CODE>mod_usertrack</CODE>, to more accurately
reflect its function (some people inadvertently thought it enabled
cookie support in Apache, which is not true - Apache supports the use
of cookies directly). It is also now possible to disable the
generation of cookies, even when
    the cookie module is compiled in. Also, an expiry time can be set
    on the cookies.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#virtualhost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt; Enhancements</A></STRONG><BR>
    The &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive can now take more than one IP
    address or hostname. This lets a single vhost handles requests
    for multiple IPs or hostnames. Also the special section
    &lt;VirtualHost _default_&gt; can be used to handle requests normally
    left for the main server configuration.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_cgi.html#cgi_debug">CGI Debugging Environment</A></STRONG><BR>
<CODE>ScriptLog</CODE> allows you to now set up a log that records
all input and output to failed CGI scripts. This includes environment
variables, input headers, POST data, output, and more. This makes CGI
scripts much easier to debug.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#rlimit">Resource Limits for CGI Scripts</A></STRONG><BR>
New directives allow the limiting of resources used by CGI scripts
(e.g. max CPU time). This is helpful in preventing 'runaway' CGI
processes.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html">Redirect Directive Can Return Alternate Status</A></STRONG><BR>
    The Redirect directive can return permanent or temporary redirects,
    "Gone" or "See Other" HTTP status. For NCSA-compatibility,
    RedirectTemp and RedirectPermanent are also implemented.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="install.html">Simplified Compilation</A></STRONG><BR>
    The process of configuring Apache for compilation has been
    simplified.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#options">Add or Remove Options</A></STRONG><BR>
    The <CODE>Options</CODE> directive can now add or remove options from
    those currently in force, rather than always replacing them.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="invoking.html#help">Command-line Help</A></STRONG><BR>
The <CODE>-h</CODE> command-line option now lists all the available
directives.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_headers.html">Optional Headers Module to Set or Remove HTTP Headers</A></STRONG><BR>
The optional <CODE>mod_headers</CODE> module can be used to set custom
headers in the HTTP response. It can append to existing headers,
replace them, or remove headers from the response.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#ifmodule">Conditional Config Directives</A></STRONG><BR>
A new <CODE>&lt;IfModule&gt;</CODE> section allows directives to be
enabled only if a given module is loaded into the server.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#satisfy">NCSA Satisfy authentication
directive now implemented</A></STRONG><BR>
<CODE>Satisfy</CODE> allows for more flexible access control
configurations.

<LI><STRONG>Better NCSA Compatibility</STRONG><BR>
Apache directives are now more compatible with NCSA 1.5 to make
moving between servers easier. In particular, Apache now implements the
<A HREF="mod/core.html#satisfy"><CODE>Satisfy</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests">MaxKeepAliveRequests</A>,
<A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectperm">RedirectPermanent</A> and
<A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#redirecttemp">RedirectTemp</A>,
directives, and the following directives are now syntax-compatible with
NCSA:
<A HREF="mod/mod_auth.html#authuserfile">AuthUserFile</A>,
<A HREF="mod/mod_auth.html#authgroupfile">AuthGroupFile</A>,
<A HREF="mod/mod_digest.html#authdigestfile">AuthDigestFile</A>,
<A HREF="mod/core.html#keepalive">KeepAlive</A> and
<A HREF="mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout">KeepAliveTimeout</A>.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html">Optional proxy module</A></STRONG><BR>
An improved FTP, HTTP, and CONNECT mode SSL proxy is included with
Apache 1.2. Some of the changes visible to users:
        <DL><DL>
        <DT>- Improved FTP proxy supporting PASV mode
        <DT>- ProxyBlock directive for excluding sites to proxy
        <DT>- NoCache * directive for disabling proxy caching
        <DT>- Numerous bug fixes
        </DL></DL>
